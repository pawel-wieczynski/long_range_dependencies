we
observe
today
not
a
victory
of
party
but
a
celebration
of
freedom
symbolizing
an
end
as
well
as
a
beginning
renewal
as
well
as
change
for
i
have
sworn
before
you
and
almighty
god
the
same
solemn
oath
our
forbears
prescribed
nearly
a
century
and
ago
the
world
is
very
different
now
for
man
holds
in
his
mortal
hands
the
power
to
abolish
all
forms
of
human
poverty
and
all
forms
of
human
life
and
yet
the
same
revolutionary
beliefs
for
which
our
forbears
fought
are
still
at
issue
around
the
globe
belief
that
the
rights
of
man
come
not
from
the
generosity
of
the
state
but
from
the
hand
of
god
we
dare
not
forget
today
that
we
are
the
heirs
of
that
first
revolution
let
the
word
go
forth
from
this
time
and
place
friend
and
foe
alike
that
the
torch
has
been
passed
to
a
new
generation
of
americans
born
in
this
century
tempered
by
war
disciplined
by
a
hard
and
bitter
peace
proud
of
our
ancient
heritage
unwilling
to
witness
or
permit
the
slow
undoing
of
those
human
rights
to
which
this
nation
has
always
been
committed
and
to
which
we
are
committed
today
home
and
around
the
world
let
every
nation
know
it
wishes
us
well
or
that
we
shall
pay
any
price
bear
any
burden
meet
any
hardship
support
any
friend
oppose
any
foe
to
assure
the
survival
and
the
success
of
liberty
this
much
we
pledge
more
to
those
old
allies
whose
cultural
and
spiritual
origins
we
share
we
pledge
the
loyalty
of
faithful
friends
united
is
little
we
can
not
do
in
a
host
of
ventures
divided
is
little
we
can
do
we
dare
not
meet
a
powerful
challenge
at
odds
and
split
asunder
to
those
new
states
whom
we
welcome
to
the
ranks
of
the
free
we
pledge
our
word
that
one
form
of
colonial
control
shall
not
have
passed
away
merely
to
be
replaced
by
a
far
more
iron
tyranny
we
shall
not
always
expect
to
find
them
supporting
our
view
but
we
shall
always
hope
to
find
them
strongly
supporting
their
own
freedom
to
remember
that
the
past
who
foolishly
sought
power
by
riding
the
back
of
the
tiger
ended
up
inside
to
those
people
in
the
huts
and
villages
of
half
the
globe
struggling
to
break
the
bonds
of
mass
misery
we
pledge
our
best
efforts
to
help
them
help
themselves
for
whatever
period
is
required
because
the
communists
may
be
doing
it
not
because
we
seek
their
votes
but
because
it
is
right
if
a
free
society
can
not
help
the
many
who
are
poor
it
can
not
save
the
few
who
are
rich
to
our
sister
republics
south
of
our
border
we
offer
a
special
pledge
to
convert
our
good
words
into
good
deeds
a
new
alliance
for
progress
assist
free
men
and
free
governments
in
casting
off
the
chains
of
poverty
but
this
peaceful
revolution
of
hope
can
not
become
the
prey
of
hostile
powers
let
all
our
neighbors
know
that
we
shall
join
with
them
to
oppose
aggression
or
subversion
anywhere
in
the
americas
let
every
other
power
know
that
this
hemisphere
intends
to
remain
the
master
of
its
own
house
to
that
world
assembly
of
sovereign
states
the
united
nations
our
last
best
hope
in
an
age
where
the
instruments
of
war
have
far
outpaced
the
instruments
of
peace
we
renew
our
pledge
of
support
prevent
it
from
becoming
merely
a
forum
for
invective
strengthen
its
shield
of
the
new
and
the
weak
and
to
enlarge
the
area
in
which
its
writ
may
run
finally
to
those
nations
who
would
make
themselves
our
adversaries
we
offer
not
a
pledge
but
a
request
that
both
sides
begin
anew
the
quest
for
peace
before
the
dark
powers
of
destruction
unleashed
by
science
engulf
all
humanity
in
planned
or
accidental
we
dare
not
tempt
them
with
weakness
for
only
when
our
arms
are
sufficient
beyond
doubt
can
we
be
certain
beyond
doubt
that
they
will
never
be
employed
but
neither
can
two
great
and
powerful
groups
of
nations
take
comfort
from
our
present
course
sides
overburdened
by
the
cost
of
modern
weapons
both
rightly
alarmed
by
the
steady
spread
of
the
deadly
atom
yet
both
racing
to
alter
that
uncertain
balance
of
terror
that
stays
the
hand
of
final
war
so
let
us
begin
anew
on
both
sides
that
civility
is
not
a
sign
of
weakness
and
sincerity
is
always
subject
to
proof
let
us
never
negotiate
out
of
fear
but
let
us
never
fear
to
negotiate
let
both
sides
explore
what
problems
unite
us
instead
of
belaboring
those
problems
which
divide
us
let
both
sides
for
the
first
time
formulate
serious
and
precise
proposals
for
the
inspection
and
control
of
arms
bring
the
absolute
power
to
destroy
other
nations
under
the
absolute
control
of
all
nations
let
both
sides
seek
to
invoke
the
wonders
of
science
instead
of
its
terrors
together
let
us
explore
the
stars
conquer
the
deserts
eradicate
disease
tap
the
ocean
depths
and
encourage
the
arts
and
commerce
let
both
sides
unite
to
heed
in
all
corners
of
the
earth
the
command
of
isaiah
undo
the
heavy
burdens
let
the
oppressed
go
free
and
if
a
beachhead
of
may
push
back
the
jungle
of
suspicion
let
both
sides
join
in
creating
not
a
new
balance
of
power
but
a
new
world
of
law
the
strong
are
just
and
the
weak
secure
the
peace
preserved
all
this
will
not
be
finished
in
the
first
one
hundred
days
nor
will
it
be
finished
in
the
first
one
thousand
days
nor
in
the
life
of
this
administration
nor
even
perhaps
in
our
lifetime
on
this
planet
but
let
us
begin
in
your
hands
my
fellow
citizens
than
mine
rest
the
final
success
or
failure
of
our
course
since
this
country
was
founded
each
generation
of
americans
has
been
summoned
to
give
testimony
to
its
national
loyalty
the
graves
of
young
americans
who
answered
the
call
to
service
surround
the
globe
now
the
trumpet
summons
us
again
not
as
a
call
to
bear
arms
though
arms
we
need
as
a
call
to
battle
though
embattled
we
are
a
call
to
bear
the
burden
of
a
long
twilight
struggle
in
and
year
out
rejoicing
in
hope
patient
in
tribulation
struggle
against
the
common
enemies
of
man
tyranny
war
itself
can
we
forge
against
these
enemies
a
grand
and
global
alliance
and
south
east
and
west
can
assure
a
more
fruitful
life
for
all
mankind
will
you
join
in
that
historic
effort
in
the
long
history
of
the
world
only
a
few
generations
have
been
granted
the
role
of
defending
freedom
in
its
hour
of
maximum
danger
i
do
not
shrink
from
this
responsibility
welcome
it
i
do
not
believe
that
any
of
us
would
exchange
places
with
any
other
people
or
any
other
generation
the
energy
the
faith
the
devotion
which
we
bring
to
this
endeavor
will
light
our
country
and
all
who
serve
it
the
glow
from
that
fire
can
truly
light
the
world
and
so
my
fellow
americans
not
what
your
country
can
do
for
you
what
you
can
do
for
your
country
my
fellow
citizens
of
the
world
not
what
america
will
do
for
you
but
what
together
we
can
do
for
the
freedom
of
man
finally
whether
you
are
citizens
of
america
or
citizens
of
the
world
ask
of
us
here
the
same
high
standards
of
strength
and
sacrifice
which
we
ask
of
you
with
a
good
conscience
our
only
sure
reward
with
history
the
final
judge
of
our
deeds
let
us
go
forth
to
lead
the
land
we
love
asking
his
blessing
and
his
help
but
knowing
that
here
on

must
truly

lincoln
gettysburg
address
given
november
on
the
battlefield
near
gettysburg
pennsylvania
usa
four
score
and
seven
years
ago
our
fathers
brought
forth
upon
this
continent
a
new
nation
conceived
in
liberty
and
dedicated
to
the
proposition
that
all
men
are
created
equal
now
we
are
engaged
in
a
great
civil
war
whether
that
nation
or
any
nation
so
conceived
and
so
dedicated
can
long
endure
we
are
met
on
a
great
battlefield
of
that
war
we
have
come
to
dedicate
a
portion
of
that
field
as
a
final
resting
place
for
those
who
here
gave
their
lives
that
this
nation
might
live
it
is
altogether
fitting
and
proper
that
we
should
do
this
but
in
a
larger
sense
we
can
not
dedicate
can
not
consecrate
we
can
not
hallow
this
ground
the
brave
men
living
and
dead
who
struggled
here
have
consecrated
it
far
above
our
poor
power
to
add
or
detract
the
world
will
little
note
nor
long
remember
what
we
say
here
but
it
can
never
forget
what
they
did
here
it
is
for
us
the
living
rather
to
be
dedicated
here
to
the
unfinished
work
which
they
who
fought
here
have
thus
far
so
nobly
advanced
it
is
rather
for
us
to
be
here
dedicated
to
the
great
task
remaining
before
us
from
these
honored
dead
we
take
increased
devotion
to
that
cause
for
which
they
gave
the
last
full
measure
of
devotion
that
we
here
highly
resolve
that
these
dead
shall
not
have
died
in
vain
that
this
nation
under
god
shall
have
a
new
birth
of
freedom
and
that
government
of
the
people
the
people
the
people
shall
not
perish

earth
