this

a
retranscription
of
one
of
the
first
project
gutenberg
etexts
offically
dated
december
and
now
officially
on
november
years
after
it
was
spoken
we
will
rerelease
the
inaugural
address
of
president

officially
on

on

the
anniversary

his
assassination

address
given

usa
four
score
and
seven
years
ago
our
fathers
brought
forth
upon
this
continent
a
new
nation
conceived
in
liberty
and
dedicated
to
the
proposition
that
all
men
are
created
equal
now
we
are
engaged
in
a
great
civil
war
whether
that
nation
or
any
nation
so
conceived
and
so
dedicated
can
long
endure
we
are
met
on
a
great
battlefield
of
that
war
we
have
come
to
dedicate
a
portion
of
that
field
as
a
final
resting
place
for
those
who
here
gave
their
lives
that
this
nation
might
live
it
is
altogether
fitting
and
proper
that
we
should
do
this
but
in
a
larger
sense
we
can
not
dedicate
can
not
consecrate
we
can
not
hallow
this
ground
the
brave
men
living
and
dead
who
struggled
here
have
consecrated
it
far
above
our
poor
power
to
add
or
detract
the
world
will
little
note
nor
long
remember
what
we
say
here
but
it
can
never
forget
what
they
did
here
it
is
for
us
the
living
rather
to
be
dedicated
here
to
the
unfinished
work
which
they
who
fought
here
have
thus
far
so
nobly
advanced
it
is
rather
for
us
to
be
here
dedicated
to
the
great
task
remaining
before
us
from
these
honored
dead
we
take
increased
devotion
to
that
cause
for
which
they
gave
the
last
full
measure
of
devotion
that
we
here
highly
resolve
that
these
dead
shall
not
have
died
in
vain
that
this
nation
under
god
shall
have
a
new
birth
of
freedom
and
that
government
of
the
people
the
people
the
people
shall
not
perish
from
this
earth
