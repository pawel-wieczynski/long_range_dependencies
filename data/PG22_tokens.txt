an

derived

published

micra
makes
no
representation
that
the
original
printed
work
on
which
this
is
based
is
now
in
the
public
domain
in
any
particular
country
however
micra
makes
no
proprietary
claims
regarding
this
electronic
version
of
the

if
the

is
currently
public

this
electronic

can
also
be
treated
as
public
domain
if
any
commercial
use
is
made
of
this
work
prior
to
january
it
is
suggested
that
an
appropriate
donation
be
made
to
micra
to
assist
in
preparing
other
such
texts
which
may
be
useful
note
that
this
version
of
has
been
supplemented
with
over
words
not
present
in
the
original
edition
but
many
modern
words
are
still
missing
about
verbs
out
of
which
can
be
found
in
an
are
absent
from
this
work
the
deficiency
of
nouns
is
probably
much
worse
especially
on
technical
topics
of
unique
words
contained
in
the
original
text
are
not
recognized
by
a
most
of
these
are
foreign
words
primarily
latin
and
many
are
obsolete
in
this
version
these
words
are
marked
as
such
by
comments
in
square
brackets
although
this
version
has
been
there
are
doubtless
numerous
residual
transcription
errors
some
of
which
may
be
obvious
even
without
reference
to
the
original
text
we
will
be
grateful
if
any
of
these
are
brought
to
our
attention
the
corrections
will
appear
in
subsequent
versions
the
original
arrangement
has
also
been
modified
slightly
in
several
places
in
particular
by
splitting
one
entry
into
two
a
version
of
the
thesaurus
which
is
almost
identical
to
the
original
only
a
small
number
of
additions
to
the
original
work
has
also
been
prepared
by
micra
and
also
carries
no
restrictions
from

the

additional
differences
will
be
noted
between
this

and
the

edition
of
the

the

common

prefixes

this

words
which
were
obsolete
in
were
marked
with
a
dagger
in
this
version
those
words
are
marked
with
a
vertical
bar
some
of
the
words
which
were
still
current
in
but
are
no
longer
found
in
a
current
dictionary
presently
obsolete
words
or
which
are
no
longer
used
in
the
specific
indicated
sense
have
been
marked
with
a
bar
followed
by
an
exclamation
point
however
this
marking
process
has
just
commenced
and
only
a
small
portion
of
the
words
which
are
now
obsolete
have
been
thus
marked
most
though
not
all
of
the
phrases
are
now
obsolete
the
obsolete
notation
indicates
that
the
previous
word
or
some
word
in
the
previous
phrase
is
not
recognized
by
the
word
processor
spelling
checker
and
also
is
either
not
in
a
modern
dictionary

is
noted
there
as
being
archaic

this
first
edition
of
this
supplemented
thesaurus
june
is
very
much
less
complete
than
the
latest
editions
of
commercial
thesauri
and
is
probably
not
suitable
for
use
as
an
adjunct
to
programs
but
it
has
no
proprietary
claims
attached
to
it
by
micra
and
does
not
contain
any
material
published
commercially
after
future
copyrighted
versions
of
this
thesaurus
are
planned
which
will
be
reorganized
in
a
hierarchical
fashion
to
maximize
the
ability
to
take
advantage
of
inheritance
of
semantic
characteristics
from
higher
categories
the
objective
is
to
create
a
database
of
words
organized
by
semantic
categories
suitable
for
use
in
understanding
programs
this
is
a
very
project
which
will
not
be
competitive
with
large
academic
or
commercial
efforts
such
as
the
cyc
project
but
is
intended
to
provide
a
convenient
resource
for
experimentation
in
processing
for
individuals
or
small
groups
anyone
who
is
currently
engaged
in
or
contemplating
a
similar
thesaurus
or
dictionary
project
who
would
be
willing

collaborate
on
this
project
is
encouraged
to
contact
us
so
that
unnecessary
duplication
of
effort
can
be
avoided
