no
secret
of
the
fact
that
he
had
used
the

like

comet
and
the
spirit
stooping
earthward
with
his
finger
on
the
meadow
traced
a
winding
pathway
for

homeward
while

ascending
through

opening
of
through

doorways
of

heaven
vanished

that
rolled
around

four
winds
honor
be
to
mudjekeewis
cried
the
warriors
cried
the
old
men
when
he
came
in
triumph
homeward
with
the
sacred
belt
of
wampum
from
the
regions
of
the
from
the
kingdom
of
wabasso
from
the
land
of
the
white
rabbit
he
had
stolen
the
belt
of
wampum
from
the
neck
of
from
the
great
bear
of
the
mountains
from
the
terror
of
the
nations
as
he
lay
asleep
and
cumbrous
on
the
summit
of
the
mountains
like
a
rock
with
mosses
on
it
spotted
brown
and
gray
with
mosses
silently
he
stole
upon
him
till
the
red
nails
of
the
monster
almost
touched
him
almost
scared
him
till
the
hot
breath
of
his
nostrils
warmed
the
hands
of
mudjekeewis
as
he
drew
the
belt
of
wampum
over
the
round
ears
that
heard
not
over
the
small
eyes
that
saw
not
over
the
long
nose
and
nostrils
the
black
muffle
of
the
nostrils
out
of
which
the
heavy
breathing
warmed
the
hands
of
mudjekeewis
then
he
swung
aloft
his
shouted
loud
and
long
his
smote
the
mighty
in
the
middle
of
the
forehead
right
between
the
eyes
he
smote
him
with
the
heavy
blow
bewildered
rose
the
great
bear
of
the
mountains
but
his
knees
beneath
him
trembled
and
he
whimpered
like
a
woman
as
he
reeled
and
staggered
forward
as
he
sat
upon
his
haunches
and
the
mighty
mudjekeewis
standing
fearlessly
before
him
taunted
him
in
loud
derision
spake
disdainfully
in
this
wise
hark
you
bear
you
are
a
coward
and
no
brave
as
you
pretended
else
you
would
not
cry
and
whimper
like
a
miserable
woman
bear
you
know
our
tribes
are
hostile
long
have
been
at
war
together
now
you
find
that
we
are
strongest
you
go
sneaking
in
the
forest
you
go
hiding
in
the
mountains
had
you
conquered
me
in
battle
not
a
groan
would
i
have
uttered
but
you
bear
sit
here
and
whimper
and
disgrace
your
tribe
by
crying
like
a
wretched
shaugodaya
like
a
cowardly
old
woman
then
again
he
raised
his
smote
again
the
in
the
middle
of
his
forehead
broke
his
skull
as
ice
is
broken
when
one
goes
to
fish
in
winter
thus
was
slain
the
he
the
great
bear
of
the
mountains
he
the
terror
of
the
nations
honor
be
to
mudjekeewis
with
a
shout
exclaimed
the
people
honor
be
to
mudjekeewis
henceforth
he
shall
be
the
and
hereafter
and
forever
shall
he
hold
supreme
dominion
over
all
the
winds
of
heaven
call
him
no
more
mudjekeewis
call
him
kabeyun
the
thus
was
mudjekeewis
chosen
father
of
the
winds
of
heaven
for
himself
he
kept
the
gave
the
others
to
his
children
unto

the
wild
and
cruel
to
the
fierce
kabibonokka
young
and
beautiful
was
wabun
he
it
was
who
brought
the
morning
he
it
was
whose
silver
arrows
chased
the
dark
hill
and
valley
he
it
was
whose
cheeks
were
painted
with
the
brightest
streaks
of
crimson
and
whose
voice
awoke
the
village
called
the
deer
and
called
the
hunter
lonely
in
the
sky
was
wabun
though
the
birds
sang
gayly
to
him
though
the
of
the
meadow
filled
the
air
with
odors
for
him
though
the
forests
and
the
rivers
sang
and
shouted
at
his
coming
still
his
heart
was
sad
within
him
for
he
was
alone
in
heaven
but
one
morning
gazing
earthward
while
the
village
still
was
sleeping
and
the
fog
lay
on
the
river
like
a
ghost
that
goes
at
sunrise
he
beheld
a
maiden
walking
all
alone
upon
a
meadow
gathering
and
rushes
by
a
river
in
the
meadow
every
morning
gazing
earthward
still
the
first
thing
he
beheld
there
was
her
blue
eyes
looking
at
him
two
blue
lakes
among
the
rushes
and
he
loved
the
lonely
maiden
who
thus
waited
for
his
coming
for
they
both
were
solitary
she
on
earth
and
he
in
heaven
and
he
wooed
her
with
caresses
wooed
her
with
his
smile
of
sunshine
with
his
flattering
words
he
wooed
her
with
his
sighing
and
his
singing
gentlest
whispers
in
the
branches
softest
music
sweetest
odors
till
he
drew
her
to
his
bosom
folded
in
his
robes
of
crimson
till
into
a
star
he
changed
her
trembling
still
upon
his
bosom
and
forever
in
the
heavens
they
are
seen
together
walking
wabun
and
the
wabun
and
the
star
of
morning
but
the
fierce
kabibonokka
had
his
dwelling
among
icebergs
in
the
everlasting
in
the
kingdom
of
wabasso
in
the
land
of
the
white
rabbit
he
it
was
whose
hand
in
autumn
painted
all
the
trees
with
scarlet
stained
the
leaves
with
red
and
yellow
he
it
was
who
sent
the
sifting
hissing
through
the
forest
froze
the
ponds
the
lakes
the
rivers
drove
the
loon
and
southward
drove
the
cormorant
and
curlew
to
their
nests
of
sedge
and
in
the
realms
of
shawondasee
once
the
fierce
kabibonokka
issued
from
his
lodge
of
from
his
home
among
the
icebergs
and
his
hair
with
snow
besprinkled
streamed
behind
him
like
a
river
like
a
black
and
wintry
river
as
he
howled
and
hurried
southward
over
frozen
lakes
and
moorlands
there
among
the
reeds
and
rushes
found
he
shingebis
the
diver
trailing
strings
of
fish
behind
him
the
frozen
fens
and
moorlands
lingering
still
among
the
moorlands
though
his
tribe
had
long
departed
to
the
land
of
shawondasee
cried
the
fierce
kabibonokka
who
is
this
that
dares
to
brave
me
dares
to
stay
in
my
dominions
when
the
wawa
has
departed
when
the
has
gone
southward
and
the
heron
the
long
ago
departed
southward
i
will
go
into
his
wigwam
i
will
put
his
smouldering
fire
out
and
at
night
kabibonokka
to
the
lodge
came
wild
and
wailing
heaped
the
snow
in
drifts
about
it
shouted
down
into
the
shook
the
in
his
fury
flapped
the
curtain
of
the
shingebis
the
diver
feared
not
shingebis
the
diver
cared
not
four
great
logs
had
he
for
firewood
one
for
each
moon
of
the
winter
and
for
food
the
fishes
served
him
by
his
blazing
fire
he
sat
there
warm
and
merry
eating
laughing
singing
o
kabibonokka
you
are
but
my
then
kabibonokka
entered
and
though
shingebis
the
diver
felt
his
presence
by
the
coldness
felt
his
icy
breath
upon
him
still
he
did
not
cease
his
singing
still
he
did
not
leave
his
laughing
only
turned
the
log
a
little
only
made
the
fire
burn
brighter
made
the
sparks
fly
up
the
from
kabibonokka
forehead
from
his
tresses
drops
of
sweat
fell
fast
and
heavy
making
dints
upon
the
ashes
as
along
the
eaves
of
lodges
as
from
drooping
boughs
of
hemlock
drips
the
melting
snow
in
making
hollows
in
the
till
at
last
he
rose
defeated
could
not
bear
the
heat
and
laughter
could
not
bear
the
merry
singing
but
rushed
headlong
through
the
stamped
upon
the
crusted
stamped
upon
the
lakes
and
rivers
made
the
snow
upon
them
harder
made
the
ice
upon
them
thicker
challenged
shingebis
the
diver
to
come
forth
and
wrestle
with
him
to
come
forth
and
wrestle
naked
on
the
frozen
fens
and
moorlands
forth
went
shingebis
the
diver
wrestled
all
night
with
the
wrestled
naked
on
the
moorlands
with
the
fierce
kabibonokka
till
his
panting
breath
grew
fainter
till
his
frozen
grasp
grew
feebler
till
he
reeled
and
staggered
backward
and
retreated
baffled
beaten
to
the
kingdom
of
wabasso
to
the
land
of
the
white
rabbit
hearing
still
the
gusty
laughter
hearing
shingebis
the
diver
singing
o
kabibonokka
you
are
but
my
shawondasee
fat
and
lazy
had
his
dwelling
far
to
southward
in
the
drowsy
dreamy
sunshine
in
the
summer
he
it
was
who
sent
the
sent
the
robin
the
opechee
sent
the

the
owaissa
sent
the

sent

northward
sent
the
melons
and
tobacco
and
the
grapes
in
purple
clusters
from
his
pipe
the
smoke
ascending
filled
the
sky
with
haze
and
vapor
filled
the
air
with
dreamy
softness
gave
a
twinkle
to
the
water
touched
the
rugged
hills
with
smoothness
brought
the
tender
indian
summer
to
the
melancholy
in
the
dreary
moon
of
listless
careless
shawondasee
in
his
life
he
had
one
shadow
in
his
heart
one
sorrow
had
he
once
as
he
was
gazing
northward
far
away
upon
a
prairie
he
beheld
a
maiden
standing
saw
a
tall
and
slender
maiden
all
alone
upon
a
prairie
brightest
green
were
all
her
garments
and
her
hair
was
like
the
sunshine
day
by
day
he
gazed
upon
her
day
by
day
he
sighed
with
passion
day
by
day
his
heart
within
him
grew
more
hot
with
love
and
longing
for
the
maid
with
yellow
tresses
but
he
was
too
fat
and
lazy
to
bestir
himself
and
woo
her
yes
too
indolent
and
easy
to
pursue
her
and
persuade
her
so
he
only
gazed
upon
her
only
sat
and
sighed
with
passion
for
the
maiden
of
the
prairie
till
one
morning
looking
northward
he
beheld
her
yellow
tresses
changed
and
covered
with
whiteness
covered
as
with
whitest
ah
my
brother
from
the
from
the
kingdom
of
wabasso
from
the
land
of
the
white
rabbit
you
have
stolen
the
maiden
from
me
you
have
laid
your
hand
upon
her
you
have
wooed
and
won
my
maiden
with
your
stories
of
the
thus
the
wretched
shawondasee
breathed
into
the
air
his
sorrow
and
the
the
prairie
wandered
warm
with
sighs
of
passion
with
the
sighs
of
shawondasee
till
the
air
seemed
full
of
full
of
the
prairie
and
the
maid
with
hair
like
sunshine
vanished
from
his
sight
forever
never
more
did
shawondasee
see
the
maid
with
yellow
tresses
poor
deluded
shawondasee
was
no
woman
that
you
gazed
at
was
no
maiden
that
you
sighed
for
was
the
prairie
dandelion
that
through
all
the
dreamy
summer
you
had
gazed
at
with
such
longing
you
had
sighed
for
with
such
passion
and
had
puffed
away
forever
blown
into
the
air
with
sighing
ah
deluded
shawondasee
thus
the
four
winds
were
divided
thus
the
sons
of
mudjekeewis
had
their
stations
in
the

at
the
corners
of

downward
through
the
evening
twilight
in
the
days
that
are
forgotten
in
the
unremembered
ages
from
the
full
moon
fell
nokomis
fell
the
beautiful
nokomis
she
a
wife
but
not
a
mother
she
was
sporting
with
her
women
swinging
in
a
swing
of
when
her
rival
the
rejected
full
of
jealousy
and
hatred
cut
the
leafy
swing
asunder
cut
in
twain
the
twisted
and
nokomis
fell
affrighted
downward
through
the
evening
twilight
on
the
muskoday
the
meadow
on
the
prairie
full
of
blossoms
see
a
star
falls
said
the
people
from
the
sky
a
star
is
falling
there
among
the
ferns
and
mosses
there
among
the
prairie
lilies
on
the

the
meadow
in

and
the

fair
nokomis
bore
a
daughter
and
she
called
her
name
wenonah
as
the
of
her
daughters
and
the
daughter
of
nokomis
grew
up
like
the
prairie
lilies
grew
a
tall
and
slender
maiden
with
the
beauty
of
the
moonlight
with
the
beauty
of
the
starlight
and
nokomis
warned
her
often
saying
oft
and
oft
repeating
oh
beware
of
mudjekeewis
of
the
mudjekeewis
listen
not
to
what
he
tells
you
lie
not
down
upon
the
meadow
stoop
not
down
among
the
lilies
lest
the
come
and
harm
you
but
she
heeded
not
the
warning
heeded
not
those
words
of
wisdom
and
the
came
at
evening
walking
lightly
the
prairie
whispering
to
the
leaves
and
blossoms
bending
low
the
flowers
and
grasses
found
the
beautiful
wenonah
lying
there
among
the
lilies
wooed
her
with
his
words
of
sweetness
wooed
her
with
his
soft
caresses
till
she
bore
a
son
in
sorrow
bore
a
son
of
love
and
sorrow
thus
was
born
my
hiawatha
thus
was
born
the
child
of
wonder
but
the
daughter
of
nokomis
hiawatha
gentle
mother
in
her
anguish
died
deserted
by
the
false
and
faithless
by
the
heartless
mudjekeewis
for
her
daughter
long
and
loudly
wailed
and
wept
the
sad
nokomis
oh
that
i
were
dead
she
murmured
oh
that
i
were
dead
as
thou
art
no

pathway
of

running
straight
across
the

crowded
with

flitting
through

of

with

of
its

lighting
up

and
he
sang

rippling
rounding
from

saw
the
flecks
and
shadows
on
it
whispered
what
is
that
nokomis
and
the
good
nokomis
answered
once
a
warrior
very
angry
seized
his
grandmother
and
threw
her
up
into
the
sky
at
midnight
right
against
the
moon
he
threw
her
is
her
body
that
you

rainbow
in
the
heaven
in
the
eastern
sky
the
rainbow
whispered
what
is
that
nokomis
and
the
good
nokomis
answered
is
the
heaven
of
flowers
you
see
there
all
the
of
the
forest
all
the
lilies
of
the
prairie
when
on
earth
they
fade
and
perish
blossom
in
that
heaven
above
us
when
he
heard
the
owls
at
midnight
hooting
laughing
in
the
forest
what
is
that
he
cried
in
terror
what
is
that
he
said
nokomis
and
the
good
nokomis
answered
that
is
but
the
owl
and
owlet
talking
in
their
native
language
talking
scolding
at
each
other
then
the
little
hiawatha
learned
of
every
bird
its
language
learned
their
names
and
all
their
secrets
how
they
built
their
nests
in
summer
where
they
hid
themselves
in
winter
talked
with
them
he
met
them
called
them
hiawatha
chickens
of
all
beasts
he
learned
the
language
learned
their
names
and
all
their
secrets
how
the
beavers
built
their
lodges
where
the
squirrels
hid
their
acorns
how
the
reindeer
ran
so
swiftly
why
the
rabbit
was
so
timid
talked
with
them
he
met
them
called
them
hiawatha
brothers
then
iagoo
the
great
boaster
he
the
marvellous
he
the
traveller
and
the
talker
he
the
friend
of
old
nokomis
made
a
bow
for
hiawatha
from
a
branch
of
ash
he
made
it
from
an
made
the
arrows
tipped
with
flint
and
winged
with
feathers
and
the
cord
he
made
of
then
he
said
to
hiawatha

my
son
into
the
forest
where
the
red
deer
herd
together
kill
for
us
a
famous
roebuck
kill
for
us
a
deer
with
antlers
forth
into
the
forest
straightway
all
alone
walked
hiawatha
proudly
with
his
bow
and
arrows
and
the
birds
sang
round
him
him
do
not
shoot
us
hiawatha
sang
the
robin

opechee
sang
the
bluebird
the
owaissa
do
not
shoot
us
hiawatha
up
the
close
beside
him
sprang
the
squirrel
adjidaumo
in
and
out
among
the
branches
coughed
and
chattered
from
the
laughed
and
said
between
his
laughing
do
not
shoot
me
hiawatha
and
the
rabbit
from
his
pathway
leaped
aside
and
at
a
distance
sat
erect
upon
his
haunches
half
in
fear
and
half
in
frolic
saying
to
the
little
hunter
do
not
shoot
me
hiawatha
but
he
heeded
not
nor
heard
them
for
his
thoughts
were
with
the
red
deer
on
their
tracks
his
eyes
were
fastened
leading
downward
to
the
river
to
the
ford
across
the
river
and
as
one
in
slumber
walked
he
hidden
in
the
there
he
waited
till
the
deer
came
till
he
saw
two
antlers
lifted
saw
two
eyes
look
from
the
thicket
saw
two
nostrils
point
to
windward
and
a
deer
came
down
the
pathway
flecked
with
leafy
light
and
shadow
and
his
heart
within
him
fluttered
trembled
like
the
leaves
above
him
like
the
palpitated
as
the
deer
came
down
the
pathway
then
upon
one
knee
uprising
hiawatha
aimed
an
arrow
scarce
a
twig
moved
with
his
motion
scarce
a
leaf
was
stirred
or
rustled
but
the
wary
roebuck
started
stamped
with
all
his
hoofs
together
listened
with
one
foot
uplifted
leaped
as
if
to
meet
the
arrow
ah
the
singing
fatal
arrow
like
a
wasp
it
buzzed
and
stung
him
dead
he
lay
there
in
the
forest
by
the
ford
across
the
river
beat
his
timid
heart
no
longer
but
the
heart
of
hiawatha
throbbed
and
shouted
and
exulted
as
he
bore
the
red
deer
homeward
and
iagoo
and
nokomis
hailed
his
coming
with
applauses
from
the
red
deer
hide
nokomis
made
a
cloak
for
hiawatha
from
the
red
deer
flesh
nokomis

forward
with
such
fleetness
that

behind
him
strong

but
the
fearless
hiawatha
heeded
not
her

warning
forth
he
strode
into
the
forest
at
each
stride
a
mile
he
measured
lurid
seemed
the
sky
above
him
lurid
seemed
the
earth
beneath
him
hot
and
close
the
air
around
him
filled
with
smoke
and
fiery
vapors
as
of
burning
woods
and
prairies
for
his
heart
was
hot
within
him
like
a
living
coal
his
heart
was
so
he
journeyed
westward
westward
left
the
fleetest
deer
behind
him
left
the
antelope
and
bison
crossed
the
rushing
esconaba
crossed
the
mighty
mississippi
passed
the
mountains
of
the
prairie
passed
the
land
of
crows
and
foxes
passed
the
dwellings
of
the
blackfeet
came
unto
the
rocky
mountains
to
the
kingdom
of
the
where
upon
the
gusty
summits
sat
the
ancient
mudjekeewis
ruler
of
the
winds
of
heaven
filled
with
awe
was
hiawatha
at
the
aspect
of
his
father
on
the
air
about
him
wildly
tossed
and
streamed
his
cloudy
tresses
gleamed
like
drifting
snow
his
tresses
glared
like
ishkoodah
the
comet
like
the
star
with
fiery
tresses
filled
with
joy
was
mudjekeewis
when
he
looked
on
hiawatha
saw
his
youth
rise
up
before
him
in
the
face
of
hiawatha
saw
the
beauty
of
wenonah
from
the
grave
rise
up
before
him
welcome
said
he
hiawatha
to
the
kingdom
of
the
long
have
i
been
waiting
for
you
youth
is
lovely
age
is
lonely
youth
is
fiery
age
is
frosty
you
bring
back
the
days
departed
you
bring
back
my
youth
of
passion
and
the
beautiful
wenonah
many
days
they
talked
together
questioned
listened
waited
answered
much
the
mighty
mudjekeewis
boasted
of
his
ancient
prowess
of
his
perilous
adventures
his
indomitable
courage
his
invulnerable
body
patiently
sat
hiawatha
listening
to
his
father
boasting
with
a
smile
he
sat
and
listened
uttered
neither
threat
nor
menace
neither
word
nor
look
betrayed
him
but
his
heart
was
hot
within
him
like
a
living
coal
his
heart
was
then
he
said
o
mudjekeewis
is
there
nothing
that
can
harm
you
nothing
that
you
are
afraid
of
and
the
mighty
mudjekeewis
grand
and
gracious
in
his
boasting
answered
saying
there
is
nothing
nothing
but
the
black
rock
yonder
nothing
but
the
fatal
wawbeek
and
he
looked
at
hiawatha
with
a
wise
look
and
benignant
with
a
countenance
paternal
looked
with
pride
upon
the
beauty
of
his
tall
and
graceful
figure
saying
o
my
hiawatha
is
there
anything
can
harm
you
anything
you
are
afraid
of
but
the
wary
hiawatha
paused
awhile
as
if
uncertain
held
his
peace
as
if
resolving
and
then
answered
there
is
nothing
nothing
but
the
bulrush
yonder
nothing
but
the
great
apukwa
and
as
mudjekeewis
rising
stretched
his
hand
to
pluck
the
bulrush
hiawatha
cried
in
terror
cried
in
terror
kago
kago
do
not
touch
it
ah
kaween
said
mudjekeewis
no
indeed
i
will
not
touch
it
then
they
talked
of
other
matters
first
of
hiawatha
brothers
first
of
wabun
of
the
of
the
shawondasee
of
the
north
kabibonokka
then
of
hiawatha
mother
of
the
beautiful
wenonah
of
her
birth
upon
the
meadow
of
her
death
as
old
nokomis
had
remembered
and
related
and
he
cried
o
mudjekeewis
it
was
you
who
killed
wenonah
took
her
young
life
and
her
beauty
broke
the
lily
of
the
prairie
trampled
it
beneath
your
footsteps
you
confess
it
you
confess
it
and
the
mighty
mudjekeewis
tossed
upon
the
wind
his
tresses
bowed
his
hoary
head
in
anguish
with
a
silent
nod
assented
then
up
started
hiawatha
and
with
threatening
look
and
gesture
laid
his
hand
upon
the
black
rock
on
the
fatal
wawbeek
laid
it
with
his
mittens
minjekahwun
rent
the
jutting
crag
asunder
smote
and
crushed
it
into
fragments
hurled
them
madly
at
his
father
the
remorseful
mudjekeewis
for
his
heart
was
hot
within
him
like
a
living
coal
his
heart
was
but
the
ruler
of
the
blew
the
fragments
backward
from
him
with
the
breathing
of
his
nostrils
with
the
tempest
of
his
anger
blew
them
back
at
his
assailant
seized
the
bulrush
the
apukwa
dragged
it
with
its
roots
and
fibres
from
the
margin
of
the
meadow
from
its
ooze
the
giant
bulrush
long
and
loud
laughed
hiawatha
then
began
the
deadly
conflict
hand
to
hand
among
the
mountains
from
his
eyry
screamed
the
eagle
the
keneu
the
great
sat
upon
the
crags
around
them
wheeling
flapped
his
wings
above
them
like
a
tall
tree
in
the
tempest
bent
and
lashed
the
giant
bulrush
and
in
masses
huge
and
heavy
crashing
fell
the
fatal
wawbeek
till
the
earth
shook
with
the
tumult
and
confusion
of
the
battle
and
the
air
was
full
of
shoutings
and
the
thunder
of
the
mountains
starting
answered
back
retreated
mudjekeewis
rushing
westward
the
mountains
stumbling
westward
down
the
mountains
three
whole
days
retreated
fighting
still
pursued
by
hiawatha
to
the
doorways
of
the
to
the
portals
of
the
sunset
to
the
earth
remotest
border
where
into
the
empty
spaces
sinks
the
sun
as
a
flamingo
drops
into
her
nest
at
nightfall
in
the
melancholy
marshes
hold
at
length
cried
mudjekeewis
hold
my
son
my
hiawatha
is
impossible
to
kill
me
for
you
can
not
kill
the
immortal
i
have
put
you
to
this
trial
but
to
know
and
prove
your
courage

the
prize
of
valor

back
to
your
home
and
people

among
them

when
the
awful
eyes
of

glare
upon
you
in
the
darkness
i
will
share
my
kingdom
with
you
ruler
shall
you
be
thenceforward
of
the
keewaydin
of
the
the
keewaydin
thus
was
fought
that
famous
battle
in
the
dreadful
days
of
in
the
days
long
since
departed
in
the
kingdom
of
the
still
the
hunter
sees
its
traces
scattered
far
hill
and
valley
sees
the
giant
bulrush
growing
by
the
ponds
and
sees
the
masses
of
the
wawbeek
lying
still
in
every
valley
homeward
now
went
hiawatha
pleasant
was
the
landscape
round
him
pleasant
was
the
air
above
him
for
the
bitterness
of
anger
had
departed
wholly
from
him
from
his
brain
the
thought
of
vengeance
from
his
heart
the
burning
fever
only
once
his
pace
he
slackened
only
once
he
paused
or
halted
paused
to
purchase
heads
of
arrows
of
the
ancient
in
the
land
of
the
dacotahs
where
the
falls
of
minnehaha
flash
and
gleam
among
the
laugh
and
leap
into
the
valley
there
the
ancient
made
his
of
sandstone
of
chalcedony
of
flint
and
jasper
smoothed
and
sharpened
at
the
edges
hard
and
polished
keen
and
costly
with
him
dwelt
his
daughter
wayward
as
the
minnehaha
with
her
moods
of
shade
and
sunshine
eyes
that
smiled
and
frowned
alternate
feet
as
rapid
as
the
river
tresses
flowing
like
the
water
and
as
musical
a
laughter
and
he
named
her
from
the
river
from
the
he
named
her
minnehaha
laughing
water
was
it
then
for
heads
of
arrows
of
chalcedony
of
flint
and
jasper
that
my
hiawatha
halted
in
the
land
of
the
dacotahs
was
it
not
to
see
the
maiden
see
the
face
of
laughing
water
peeping
from
behind
the
curtain
hear
the
rustling
of
her
garments
from
behind
the
waving
curtain
as
one
sees
the
minnehaha
gleaming
glancing
through
the
branches
as
one
hears
the
laughing
water
from
behind
its
screen
of
branches
who
shall
say
what
thoughts
and
visions
fill
the
fiery
brains
of
young
men
who
shall
say
what
dreams
of
beauty
filled
the
heart
of
hiawatha
all
he
told
to
old
nokomis
when
he
reached
the
lodge
at
sunset
was
the
meeting
with
his
father
was
his
fight
with
mudjekeewis
not
a
word

said
of
arrows
not
a
word
of
laughing
water
v
hiawatha
fasting
you
shall
hear
how
hiawatha
prayed
and
fasted
in
the
forest
not
for
greater
skill
in
hunting
not
for
greater
craft
in
fishing
not
for
triumphs
in
the
battle
and
renown
among
the
warriors
but
for
profit
of
the
people
for
advantage
of
the
nations
first
he
built
a
lodge
for
fasting
built
a
wigwam
in
the
forest
by
the
shining
in
the
blithe
and
pleasant
in
the
moon
of
leaves
he
built
it
and
with
dreams
and
visions
many
seven
whole
days
and
nights
he
fasted
on
the
first
day
of
his
fasting
through
the
leafy
woods
he
wandered
saw
the
deer
start
from
the
thicket
saw
the
rabbit
in
his
burrow
heard
the
pheasant
bena
drumming
heard
the
squirrel
adjidaumo
rattling
in
his
hoard
of
acorns
saw
the
pigeon

pinetrees
and
in
flocks
the
wawa
flying
to
the
northward
whirring
wailing

above
him

cried
desponding
must
our
lives
depend
on
these
things
on
the
next
day
of
his
fasting
by
the
river
brink
he
wandered
through
the
muskoday

meadow
saw
the
wild
rice

saw
the
blueberry
meenahga
and
the
strawberry
odahmin
and

cried
desponding
must
our
lives
depend
on
these
things
on
the
third
day
of
his
fasting
by
the
lake
he
sat
and
pondered
by
the
still
transparent
water
saw
the
sturgeon
nahma
leaping
scattering
drops
like
beads
of
wampum
saw
the
yellow
perch

sahwa
like
a
sunbeam

he
cried
desponding
must
our
lives
depend
on
these
things
on
the
fourth
day
of
his
fasting
in
his
lodge
he
lay
exhausted
from
his
couch
of
leaves
and
branches
gazing
with
eyelids
full
of
shadowy
dreams
and
visions
on
the
dizzy
swimming
landscape
on
the
gleaming
of
the
water
on
the
splendor
of
the
sunset
and
he
saw
a
youth
approaching
dressed
in
garments
green
and
yellow
coming
through
the
purple
twilight
through
the
splendor
of
the
sunset
plumes
of
green
bent
his
forehead
and
his
hair
was
soft
and
golden
standing
at
the
open
doorway
long
he
looked
at
hiawatha
looked
with
pity
and
compassion
on
his
wasted
form
and
features
and
in
accents
like
the
sighing
of
the
in
the
said
he
o
my
hiawatha
all
your
prayers
are
heard
in
heaven
for
you
pray
not
like
the
others
not
for
greater
skill
in
hunting
not
for
greater
craft
in
fishing
not
for
triumph
in
the
battle
nor
renown
among
the
warriors
but
for
profit
of
the
people
for
advantage
of
the
nations
from
the
master
of

descending
i
the
friend
of
man
mondamin
come
to
warn
you
and
instruct
you
how
by
struggle
and
by
labor
you
shall
gain
what
you
have
prayed
for
rise
up
from
your
bed
of
branches
rise
o
youth
and
wrestle
with
me
faint
with
famine
hiawatha
started
from
his
bed
of
branches
from
the
twilight
of
his
wigwam
forth
into
the
flush
of
sunset
came
and
wrestled
with
mondamin
at
his
touch
he
felt
new
courage
throbbing
in
his
brain
and
bosom
felt
new
life
and
hope
and
vigor
run
through
every
nerve
and
fibre
so
they
wrestled
there
together
in
the
glory
of
the
sunset
and
the
more
they
strove
and
struggled
stronger
still
grew
hiawatha
till
the
darkness
fell
around
them
and
the
heron
the
from
her
nest
among
the
gave
a
cry
of
lamentation
gave
a
scream
of
pain
and
famine
is
enough
then
said
mondamin
smiling
upon
hiawatha
but
tomorrow
when
the
sun
sets
i
will
come
again
to
try
you
and
he
vanished
and
was
seen
not
whether
sinking
as
the
rain
sinks
whether
rising
as
the
mists
rise
hiawatha
saw
not
knew
not
only
saw
that
he
had
vanished
leaving
him
alone
and
fainting
with
the
misty
lake
below
him
and
the
reeling
stars
above
him
on
the
morrow
and
the
next
day
when
the
sun
through
heaven
descending
like
a
red
and
burning
cinder
from
the
hearth
of
the
great
spirit
fell
into
the
western
waters
came
mondamin
for
the
trial
for
the
strife
with
hiawatha
came
as
silent
as
the
dew
comes
from
the
empty
air
appearing
into
empty
air
returning
taking
shape
when
earth
it
touches
but
invisible
to
all
men
in
its
coming
and
its
going
thrice
they
wrestled
there
together
in
the
glory
of
the
sunset
till
the
darkness
fell
around
them
till
the
heron
the
from
her
nest
among
the
uttered
her
loud
cry
of
famine
and
mondamin
paused
to
listen
tall
and
beautiful
he
stood
there
in
his
garments
green
and
yellow
to
and
fro
his
plumes
above
him
waved
and
nodded
with
his
breathing
and
the
sweat
of
the
encounter
stood
like
drops
of
dew
upon
him
and
he
cried
o
hiawatha
bravely
have
you
wrestled
with
me
thrice
have
wrestled
stoutly
with
me
and
the
master
of
life
who
sees
us
he
will
give
to
you
the
triumph
then
he
smiled
and
said
is
the
last
day
of
your
conflict
is
the
last
day
of
your
fasting
you
will
conquer
and
me
make
a
bed
for
me
to
lie
in
where
the
rain
may
fall
upon
me
where
the
sun
may
come
and
warm
me
strip
these
garments
green
and
yellow
strip
this
nodding
plumage
from
me
lay
me
in
the
earth
and
make
it
soft
and
loose
and
light
above
me
let
no
hand
disturb
my
slumber
let
no
weed
nor
worm
molest
me
let
not
kahgahgee
the
raven
come
to
haunt
me
and
molest
me
only
come
yourself
to
watch
me
till
i
wake
and
start
and
quicken
till
i
leap
into
the
sunshine
and
thus
saying
he
departed
peacefully
slept
hiawatha
but
he
heard
the
wawonaissa
heard
the
whippoorwill
complaining
perched
upon
his
lonely
wigwam
heard
the
rushing
sebowisha
heard
the
rivulet
rippling
near
him
talking
to
the
darksome
forest
heard
the
sighing
of
the
branches
as
they
lifted
and
subsided
at
the
passing
of
the
heard
them
as
one
hears
in
slumber
murmurs
dreamy
whispers
peacefully
slept
hiawatha
on
the
morrow
came
nokomis
on
the
seventh
day
of
his
fasting
came
with
food
for
hiawatha
came
imploring
and
bewailing
lest
his
hunger
should
him
lest
his
fasting
should
be
fatal
but
he
tasted
not
and
touched
not
only
said
to
her
nokomis
wait
until
the
sun
is
setting
till
the
darkness
falls
around
us
till
the
heron
the
crying
from
the
desolate
marshes
tells
us
that
the
day
is
ended
homeward
weeping
went
nokomis
sorrowing
for
her
hiawatha
fearing
lest
his
strength
should
fail
him
lest
his
fasting
should
be
fatal
he
meanwhile
sat
weary
waiting
for
the
coming
of
mondamin
till
the
shadows
pointing
eastward
lengthened
over
field
and
forest
till
the
sun
dropped
from
the
heaven
floating
on
the
waters
westward
as
a
red
leaf
in
the
autumn
falls
and
floats
upon
the
water
falls
and
sinks
into
its
bosom
and
behold
the
young
mondamin
with
his
soft
and
shining
tresses
with
his
garments
green
and
yellow
with
his
long
and
glossy
plumage
stood
and
beckoned
at
the
doorway
and
as
one
in
slumber
walking
pale
and
haggard
but
undaunted
from
the
wigwam
hiawatha
came
and
wrestled
with
mondamin
round
about
him
spun
the
landscape
sky
and
forest
reeled
together
and
his
strong
heart
leaped
within
him
as
the
sturgeon
leaps
and
struggles
in
a
net
to
break
its
meshes
like
a
ring
of
fire
around
him
blazed
and
flared
the
red
horizon
and
a
hundred
suns
seemed
looking
at
the
combat
of
the
wrestlers
suddenly
upon
the
greensward
all
alone
stood
hiawatha
panting
with
his
wild
exertion
palpitating
with
the
struggle
and
before
him
breathless
lifeless
lay
the
youth
with
hair
dishevelled
plumage
torn
and
garments
tattered
dead
he
lay
there
in
the
sunset
and
victorious
hiawatha
made
the
grave
as
he
commanded
stripped
the
garments
from
mondamin
stripped
his
tattered
plumage
from
him
laid
him
in
the
earth
and
made
it
soft
and
loose
and
light
above
him
and
the
heron
the
from
the
melancholy
moorlands
gave
a
cry
of
lamentation
gave
a
cry
of
pain
and
anguish
homeward
then
went
hiawatha
to
the
lodge
of
old
nokomis
and
the
seven
days
of
his
fasting
were
accomplished
and
completed
but
the
place
was
not
forgotten
where
he
wrestled
with
mondamin
nor
forgotten
nor
neglected
was
the
grave
where
lay
mondamin
sleeping
in
the
rain
and
sunshine
where
his
scattered
plumes
and
garments
faded
in
the
rain
and
sunshine
day
by
day
did
hiawatha
go
to
wait
and
watch
beside
it
kept
the
dark
mould
soft
above
it
kept
it
clean
from
weeds
and
insects
drove
away
with
scoffs
and
shoutings
kahgahgee
the
king
of
ravens
till
at
length
a
small
green
feather
from
the
earth
shot
slowly
upward
then
another
and
another
and
before
the
summer
ended
stood
the
maize
in
all
its
beauty
with
its
shining
robes
about
it
and
its
long
soft
yellow
tresses
and
in
rapture
hiawatha
cried
aloud
it
is
mondamin
yes
the
friend
of
man
mondamin
then
he
called
to
old
nokomis
and
iagoo
the
great
boaster
showed
them
where
the
maize
was
growing
told
them
of
his
wondrous
vision
of
his
wrestling
and
his
triumph
of
this
new
gift
to
the
nations
which
should
be
their
food
forever
and
still
later
when
the
autumn
changed
the
long
green
leaves
to
yellow
and
the
soft
and
juicy
kernels
grew
like
wampum
hard
and
yellow
then
the
ripened
ears
he
gathered
stripped
the
withered
husks
from
off
them
as
he
once
had
stripped
the
wrestler
gave
the
first
feast
of
mondamin
and
made
known
unto
the
people
this
new
gift
of
the
great
spirit
vi
hiawatha
friends
two
good
friends
had
hiawatha
singled
out
from
all
the
others
bound
to
him
in
closest
union
and
to
whom
he
gave
the
right
hand
of
his
heart
in
joy
and
sorrow
chibiabos
the
musician
and
the
very
strong
man
kwasind
straight
between
them
ran
the
pathway
never
grew
the
grass
upon
it
singing
birds
that
utter
falsehoods
found
no
eager
ear
to
listen
could
not
breed
between
them
for
they
kept
each
other
counsel
spake
with
naked
hearts
together
pondering
much
and
much
contriving
how
the
tribes
of
men
might
prosper
most
beloved
by
hiawatha
was
the
gentle
chibiabos
he
the
best
of
all
musicians
he
the
sweetest
of
all
singers
beautiful
and
childlike
was
he
brave
as
man
is
soft
as
woman
pliant
as
a
wand
of
willow
stately
as
a
deer
with
antlers
when
he
sang
the
village
listened
all
the
warriors
gathered
round
him
all
the
women
came
to
hear
him
now
he
stirred
their
souls
to
passion
now
he
melted
them
to
pity
from
the
hollow
reeds
he
fashioned
flutes
so
musical
and
mellow
that
the
brook
the
sebowisha
ceased
to
murmur
in
the
woodland
that
the
ceased
from
singing
and
the
squirrel
adjidaumo
ceased
his
chatter
in
the
and
the
rabbit
the
wabasso
sat
upright
to
look
and
listen

to
flow
in
music

teach
me
tones
as
melancholy
teach
me
songs
as
full
of
sadness
all
the
many
sounds
of
nature
borrowed
sweetness
from
his
singing
all
the
hearts
of
men
were
softened
by
the
pathos
of
his
music
for
he
sang
of
peace
and
freedom
sang
of
beauty
love
and
longing
sang
of
death
and
life
undying
in
the
islands
of
the
blessed
in
the
kingdom
of
ponemah
in
the
land
of
the
hereafter
very
dear
to
hiawatha
was
the
gentle
chibiabos
he
the
best
of
all
musicians
he
the
sweetest
of
all
singers
for
his
gentleness
he
loved
him
and
the
magic
of
his
singing
dear
too
unto
hiawatha
was
the
very
strong
man
kwasind
he
the
strongest
of
all
mortals
he
the
mightiest
among
many
for
his
very
strength
he
loved
him
for
his
strength
allied
to
goodness
idle
in
his
youth
was
kwasind
very
listless
dull
and
dreamy
never
played
with
other
children
never
fished
and
never
hunted
not
like
other
children
was
he
but
they
saw
that
much
he
fasted
much
his
manito
entreated
much
besought
his
guardian
spirit
lazy
kwasind
said
his
mother
in
my
work
you
never
help
me
in
the
summer
you
are
roaming
idly
in
the
fields
and
forests
in
the
winter
you
are
cowering
the
firebrands
in
the
wigwam
in
the
coldest
days
of
winter
i
must
break
the
ice
for
fishing
with
my
nets
you
never
help
me
at
the
door
my
nets
are
hanging
dripping
freezing
with
the
water
go
and
wring
them
yenadizze
go
and
dry
them
in
the
sunshine
slowly
from
the
ashes
kwasind
rose
but
made
no
angry
answer
from
the
lodge
went
forth
in
silence
took
the
nets
that
hung
together
dripping
freezing
at
the
doorway
like
a
wisp
of
straw
he
wrung
them
like
a
wisp
of
straw
he
broke
them
could
not
wring
them
without
breaking
such
the
strength
was
in
his
fingers
lazy
kwasind
said
his
father
in
the
hunt
you
never
help
me
every
bow
you
touch
is
broken
snapped
asunder
every
arrow
yet
come
with
me
to
the
forest
you
shall
bring
the
hunting
homeward
down
a
narrow
pass
they
wandered
where
a
brooklet
led
them
onward
where
the
trail
of
deer
and
bison
marked
the
soft
mud
on
the
margin
till
they
found
all
further
passage
shut
against
them
barred
securely
by
the
trunks
of
trees
uprooted
lying
lengthwise
lying
crosswise
and
forbidding
further
passage
we
must
go
back
said
the
old
man
these
logs
we
can
not
clamber
not
a
woodchuck
could
get
through
them
not
a
squirrel
clamber
them
and
straightway
his
pipe
he
lighted
and
sat
down
to
smoke
and
ponder
but
before
his
pipe
was
finished
lo
the
path
was
cleared
before
him
all
the
trunks
had
kwasind
lifted
to
the
right
hand
to
the
left
hand
shot
the
swift
as
arrows
hurled
the
cedars
light
as
lances
lazy
kwasind
said
the
young
men
as
they
sported
in
the
meadow
why
stand
idly
looking
at
us
leaning
on
the
rock
behind
you
come
and
wrestle
with
the
others
let
us
pitch
the
quoit
together
lazy
kwasind
made
no
answer
to
their
challenge
made
no
answer
only
rose
and
slowly
turning
seized
the
huge
rock
in
his
fingers
tore
it
from
its
deep
foundation
poised
it
in
the
air
a
moment
pitched
it
sheer
into
the
river
sheer
into
the
swift
pauwating
where
it
still
is
seen
in
summer
once
as
down
that
foaming
river
down
the
rapids
of
pauwating
kwasind
sailed
with
his
companions
in
the
stream
he
saw
a
beaver
saw
ahmeek
the
king
of
beavers
struggling
with
the
rushing
currents
rising
sinking
in
the
water
without
speaking
without
pausing
kwasind
leaped
into
the
river
plunged
beneath
the
bubbling
surface
through
the
whirlpools
chased
the
beaver
followed
him
among
the
islands
stayed
so
long
beneath
the
water
that
his
terrified
companions
cried
alas
to
kwasind
we
shall
never
more
see
kwasind
but
he
reappeared
triumphant
and
upon
his
shining
shoulders
brought
the
beaver
dead
and
dripping
brought
the
king
of
all
the
beavers
and
these
two
as
i
have
told
you
were
the
friends
of
hiawatha
chibiabos
the
musician
and
the
very
strong
man
kwasind
long
they
lived
in

stately
in

i
a

canoe
will
build

lay
aside
your
wrapper
for
the
is
coming
and
the
sun
is
warm
in
heaven
and
you
need
no
wrapper
thus
aloud
cried
hiawatha
in
the
solitary
forest
by
the
rushing
taquamenaw
when
the
birds
were
singing
gayly
in
the
moon
of
leaves
were
singing
and
the
sun
from
sleep
awaking
started
up
and
said
behold
me
gheezis
the
great
sun
behold
me
and
the
tree
with
all
its
branches
rustled
in
the
breeze
of
morning
saying
with
a
sigh
of
patience
take
my
cloak
o
hiawatha
with
his
knife
the
tree
he
girdled
just
beneath
its
lowest
branches
just
above
the
roots
he
cut
it
till
the
sap
came
oozing
outward
down
the
trunk
from
top
to
bottom
sheer
he
cleft
the
bark
asunder
with
a
wooden
wedge
he
raised
it
stripped
it
from
the
trunk
unbroken
give
me
of
your
boughs
o
cedar
of
your
strong
and
pliant
branches
my
canoe
to
make
more
steady
make
more
strong
and
firm
beneath
me
through
the
summit
of
the
cedar
went
a
sound
a
cry
of
horror
went
a
murmur
of
resistance
but
it
whispered
bending
downward
take
my
boughs
o
hiawatha
down
he
hewed
the
boughs
of
cedar
shaped
them
straightway
to
a
like
two
bows
he
formed
and
shaped
them
like
two
bended
bows
together
give
me
of
your
roots
o
tamarack
of
your
fibrous
roots
o
my
canoe
to
bind
together
so
to
bind
the
ends
together
that
the
water
may
not
enter
that
the
river
may
not
wet
me
and
the
larch
with
all
its
fibres
shivered
in
the
air
of
morning
touched
his
forehead
with
its
tassels
slid
with
one
long
sigh
of
sorrow
take
them
all
o
hiawatha
from
the
earth
he
tore
the
fibres
tore
the
tough
roots
of
the
closely
sewed
the
bark
together
bound
it
closely
to
the
give
me
of
your
balm
o
of
your
balsam
and
your
resin
so
to
close
the
seams
together
that
the
water
may
not
enter
that
the
river
may
not
wet
me
and
the
tall
and
sombre
sobbed
through
all
its
robes
of
darkness
rattled
like
a
shore
with
pebbles
answered
wailing
answered
weeping
take
my
balm
o
hiawatha
and
he
took
the
tears
of
balsam
took
the
resin
of
the
smeared
therewith
each
seam
and
fissure
made
each
crevice
safe
from
water
give
me
of
your
quills
o
hedgehog
all
your
quills
o
kagh
the
hedgehog
i
will
make
a
necklace
of
them
make
a
girdle
for
my
beauty
and
two
stars
to
deck
her
bosom
from
a
hollow
tree
the
hedgehog
with
his
sleepy
eyes
looked
at
him
shot
his
shining
quills
like
arrows
saying
with
a
drowsy
murmur
through
the
tangle
of
his
whiskers
take
my
quills
o
hiawatha
from
the
ground
the
quills
he
gathered
all
the
little
shining
arrows
stained
them
red
and
blue
and
yellow
with
the
juice
of
roots
and
berries
into
his
canoe
he
wrought
them
round
its
waist
a
shining
girdle
round
its
bows
a
gleaming
necklace
on
its
breast
two
stars
resplendent
thus
the
birch
canoe
was
builded
in
the
valley
by
the
river
in
the
bosom
of
the
forest
and
the
forest
life
was
in
it
all
its
mystery
and
its
magic
all
the
lightness
of
the
all
the
toughness
of
the
cedar
all
the
larch
supple
sinews
and
it
floated
on
the
river
like
a
yellow
leaf
in
autumn
like
a
yellow
paddles
none
had
hiawatha
paddles
none
he
had
or
needed
for
his
thoughts
as
paddles
served
him
and
his
wishes
served
to
guide
him
swift
or
slow
at
will
he
glided
veered
to
right
or
left
at
pleasure
then
he
called
aloud
to
kwasind
to
his
friend
the
strong
man
kwasind
saying
help
me
clear
this
river
of
its
sunken
logs
and
straight
into
the
river
kwasind
plunged
as
if
he
were
an
otter
dived
as
if
he
were
a

stood
up
to
his
waist
in
water
to
his
in
the
river
swam
and
scouted
in
the
river
tugged
at
sunken
logs
and
branches
with
his
hands
he
scooped
the
with
his
feet
the
ooze
and
tangle
and
thus
sailed
my
hiawatha
down
the
rushing
taquamenaw
sailed
through
all
its
bends
and
windings
sailed
through
all
its
deeps
and
shallows
while
his
friend
the
strong
man
kwasind
swam
the
deeps
the
shallows
waded
up
and
down
the
river
went
they
in
and
out
among
its
islands
cleared
its
bed
of
root
and
dragged
the
dead
trees
from
its
channel
made
its
passage
safe
and
certain
made
a
pathway
for
the
people
from
its

and
he
dropped

through

waited
vainly
for
an
answer
long
sat
waiting
for
an

repeating

listening
to
his
call

clamor
his

he
wearied
of

rude
fellow
break
the
line
of
hiawatha
in
his
fingers
hiawatha
felt
the
loose
line
jerk
and
tighten
as
he
drew
it
in
it
tugged
so
that
the
birch
canoe
stood
endwise
like
a
birch
log
in
the
water
with
the
squirrel
adjidaumo
perched
and
frisking
on
the
summit
full
of
scorn
was
hiawatha
when
he
saw
the
fish
rise
upward
saw
the
pike
the
maskenozha
coming
nearer
nearer
to
him
and
he
shouted
through
the
water
esa
esa
shame
upon
you
you
are
but
the
pike
kenozha
you
are
not
the
fish
i
wanted
you
are
not
the
king
of
fishes
reeling
downward
to
the
bottom
sank
the
pike
in
great
confusion
and
the
mighty
sturgeon
nahma
said
to
ugudwash
the
to
the
bream
with
scales
of
crimson
take
the
bait
of
this
great
boaster
break
the
line
of
hiawatha
slowly
upward
wavering
gleaming
rose
the
ugudwash
the
seized
the
line
of
hiawatha
swung
with
all
his
weight
upon
it
made
a
whirlpool
in
the
water
whirled
the
birch
canoe
in
circles
round
and
round
in
gurgling
eddies
till
the
circles
in
the
water
reached
the
sandy
beaches
till
the
and
rushes
nodded
on
the
distant
margins
but
when
hiawatha
saw
him
slowly
rising
through
the
water
lifting
up
his
disk
refulgent
loud
he
shouted
in
derision
esa
esa
shame
upon
you
you
are
ugudwash
the
you
are
not
the
fish
i
wanted
you
are
not
the
king
of
fishes
slowly
downward
wavering
gleaming
sank
the
ugudwash
the
and
again
the
sturgeon
nahma
heard
the
shout
of
hiawatha
heard
his
challenge
of
defiance
the
unnecessary
tumult
ringing
far
across
the
water
from
the
white
sand
of
the
bottom
up
he
rose
with
angry
gesture
quivering
in
each
nerve
and
fibre
clashing
all
his
plates
of
armor
gleaming
bright
with
all
his
in
his
wrath
he
darted
upward
flashing
leaped
into
the
sunshine
opened
his
great
jaws
and
swallowed
both
canoe
and
hiawatha
down
into
that
darksome
cavern
plunged
the
headlong
hiawatha
as
a
log
on
some
black
river
shoots
and
plunges
down
the
rapids
found
himself
in
utter
darkness
groped
about
in
helpless
wonder
till
he
felt
a
great
heart
beating
throbbing
in
that
utter
darkness
and
he
smote
it
in
his
anger
with
his
fist
the
heart
of
nahma
felt
the
mighty
king
of
fishes
shudder
through
each
nerve
and
fibre
heard
the
water
gurgle
round
him
as
he
leaped
and
staggered
through
it
sick
at
heart
and
faint
and
weary
crosswise
then
did
hiawatha
drag
his
for
safety
lest
from
out
the
jaws
of
nahma
in
the
turmoil
and
confusion
forth
he
might
be
hurled
and
perish
and
the
squirrel
adjidaumo
frisked
and
chatted
very
gayly
toiled
and
tugged
with
hiawatha
till
the
labor
was
completed
then
said
hiawatha
to
him
o
my
little
friend
the
squirrel
bravely
have
you
toiled
to
help
me
take
the
thanks
of
hiawatha
and
the
name
which
now
he
gives
you
for
hereafter
and
forever
boys
shall
call
you
adjidaumo
the
boys
shall
call
you
and
again
the
sturgeon
nahma
gasped
and
quivered
in
the
water
then
was
still
and
drifted
landward
till
he
grated
on
the
pebbles
till
the
listening
hiawatha
heard
him
grate
upon
the
margin
felt
him
strand
upon
the
pebbles
knew
that
nahma
king
of
fishes
lay
there
dead
upon
the
margin
then
he
heard
a
clang
and
flapping
as
of
many
wings
assembling
heard
a
screaming
and
confusion
as
of
birds
of
prey
contending
saw
a
gleam
of
light
above
him
shining
through
the
ribs
of
nahma
saw
the
glittering
eyes
of
of
kayoshk
the
peering
gazing
at
him
through
the
opening
heard
them
saying
to
each
other
is
our
brother
hiawatha
and
he
shouted
from
below
them
cried
exulting
from
the
caverns
o

my
brothers

slain
the
sturgeon

speak
of

calling

kayoshk
the
yes

the
noble
scratchers
and
the
wild
and
clamorous
toiled
with
beak
and
claws
together
made
the
rifts
and
openings
wider
in
the
mighty
ribs
of
nahma
and
from
peril
and
from
prison
from
the
body
of
the
sturgeon
from
the
peril
of
the
water
they
released
my
hiawatha
he
was
standing
near
his
wigwam
on
the
margin
of
the
water
and
he
called
to
old
nokomis
called
and
beckoned
to
nokomis
pointed
to
the
sturgeon
nahma
lying
lifeless
on
the
pebbles
with

wait
until
their
meal
is
ended
till
their
craws
are
full
with
feasting
till
they
homeward
fly
at
sunset
to
their
nests
among
the
marshes
then
bring
all
your
pots
and
kettles
and
make
oil
for
us
in
winter
and
she
waited
till
the
sun
set
till
the
pallid
moon
the
rose
above
the
tranquil
water
till
kayoshk
the
sated
from
their
banquet
rose
with
clamor
and
across
the
fiery
sunset
winged
their
way
to
islands
to
their
nests
among
the
rushes
to
his
sleep
went
hiawatha
and
nokomis
to
her
labor
toiling
patient
in
the
moonlight
till
the
sun
and
moon
changed
places
till
the
sky
was
red
with
sunrise
and
kayoshk
the
hungry
came
back
from
the
reedy
islands
clamorous
for
their
morning
banquet
three
whole
days

nights

upon

the
on

pointing
westward
to
the
purple
clouds
of
sunset
fiercely
the

sun
descending
burned
his
way
along

set
the

behind
him
as

retreating

suddenly
starting

nokomis
the

to
the

of

he
it
was
who
slew
my
father
by
his
wicked
wiles
and
cunning
when
he
from

descended
when
he
came
on

to
seek

he
the
mightiest

people
from

straightway
then
my
hiawatha
armed
himself
with
all
his
launched
his
for
sailing
with
his
palm
its
sides
he
patted
said
with
glee
cheemaun
my

o

forward
where
you
see
the
fiery
serpents
where
you
see
the

forward
leaped
cheemaun
exulting
and
the
noble
hiawatha
sang
his
wild
and
woful
and
above
him
the
the
keneu
the
great
master
of
all
fowls
with
feathers
screamed
and
hurtled
through
the
heavens
soon
he
reached
the
fiery
serpents
the
kenabeek
the
great
serpents
lying
huge
upon
the
water
sparkling
rippling
in
the
water
lying
coiled
across
the
passage
with
their
blazing
crests
uplifted
breathing
fiery
fogs
and
vapors
so
that
none
could
pass
beyond
them
but
the
fearless
hiawatha
cried
aloud
and
spake
in
this
wise
let
me
pass
my
way
kenabeek
let
me
go
upon
my
journey
and
they
answered
hissing
fiercely
with
their
fiery
breath
made
answer
back
go
back
o
shaugodaya
back
to
old
nokomis
then
the
angry
hiawatha
raised
his
mighty
bow
of
seized
his
arrows
shot
them
fast
among
the
serpents
every
twanging
of
the
was
a
and
a
every
whizzing
of
an
arrow
was
a
of
kenabeek
weltering
in
the
bloody
water
dead
lay
all
the
fiery
serpents
and
among
them
hiawatha
harmless
sailed
and
cried
exulting
onward
o
cheemaun
my
darling
onward
to
the
black
then
he
took
the
oil
of
nahma
and
the
bows
and
sides
anointed
smeared
them
well
with
oil
that
swiftly
he
might
pass
the
black
all
night
long
he
sailed
upon
it
sailed
upon
that
sluggish
water
covered
with
its
mould
of
ages
black
with
rotting
rank
with
flags
and
leaves
of
lilies
stagnant
lifeless
dreary
dismal
lighted
by
the
shimmering
moonlight
and
by
illumined
fires
by
ghosts
of
dead
men
kindled
in
their
weary
all
the
air
was
white
with
moonlight
all
the
water
black
with
shadow
and
around
him
the
suggema
the
mosquito
sang
his
and
the
waved
their
torches
to
mislead
him
and
the
the
dahinda
thrust
his
head
into
the
moonlight
fixed
his
yellow
eyes
upon
him
sobbed
and
sank
beneath
the
surface
and
anon
a
thousand
whistles
answered
over
all
the
and
the
heron
the
far
off
on
the
reedy
margin
heralded
the
hero
coming
westward
thus
fared
hiawatha
toward
the
realm
of
megissogwon
toward
the
land
of
the
till
the
level
moon
stared
at
him
in
his
face
stared
pale
and
haggard
till
the
sun
was
hot
behind
him
till
it
burned
upon
his
shoulders
and
before
him
on
the
upland
he
could
see
the
shining
wigwam
of
the
manito
of
wampum
of
the
mightiest
of
magicians
then
once
more
cheemaun
he
patted
to
his
said
onward
and
it
stirred
in
all
its
fibres
and
with
one
great
bound
of
triumph
leaped
across
the
leaped
through
tangled
flags
and
rushes
and
upon
the
beach
beyond
them
landed
hiawatha
straight
he
took
his
bow
of
on
the
sand
one
end
he
rested
with
his
knee
he
pressed
the
middle
stretched
the
faithful
tighter
took
an
arrow
jasperheaded
shot
it
at
the
shining
wigwam
sent
it
singing
as
a
herald
as
a
bearer
of
his
message
of
his
challenge
loud
and
lofty
come
forth
from
your
lodge
hiawatha
waits
your
coming
straightway
from
the
shining
wigwam
came
the
mighty
megissogwon
tall
of
stature
broad
of
shoulder
dark
and
terrible
in
aspect
clad
from
head
to
foot
in
wampum
armed
with
all
his
warlike
weapons
painted
like
the
sky
of
morning
streaked
with
crimson
blue
and
yellow
crested
with
great
streaming
upward
streaming
outward
well
i
know
you
hiawatha
cried
he
in
a
voice
of
thunder
in
a
tone
of
loud
derision
hasten
back
o
shaugodaya
hasten
back
among
the
women
back
to
old
nokomis
i
will
slay
you
as
you
stand
there
as
of
old
i
slew
her
father
but
my
hiawatha
answered
nothing
daunted
fearing
nothing
big
words
do
not
smite
like
boastful
breath
is
not
a
taunts
are
not
so
sharp
as
arrows
deeds
are
better
things
than
words
are
actions
mightier
than
boastings
then
began
the
greatest
battle
that
the
sun
had
ever
looked
on
that
the
ever
witnessed
all
a
summer
day
it
lasted
from
the
sunrise
to
the
sunset
for
the
shafts
of
hiawatha
harmless
hit
the
shirt
of
wampum
harmless
fell
the
blows
he
dealt
it
with
his
mittens
minjekahwun
harmless
fell
the
heavy
it
could
dash
the
rocks
asunder
but
it
could
not
break
the
meshes
of
that
magic
shirt
of
wampum
till
at
sunset
hiawatha
leaning
on
his
bow
of
wounded
weary
and
desponding
with
his
mighty
broken
with
his
mittens
torn
and
tattered
and
three
useless
arrows
only
paused
to
rest
beneath
a
from
whose
branches
trailed
the
mosses
and
whose
trunk
was
coated
over
with
the
with
the
fungus
white
and
yellow
suddenly
from
the
boughs
above
him
sang
the
mama
the
woodpecker
aim
your
arrows
hiawatha
at
the
head
of
megissogwon
strike
the
tuft
of
hair
upon
it
at
their
roots
the
long
black
tresses
there
alone
can
he
be
wounded
winged
with
feathers
tipped
with
jasper
swift
flew
hiawatha
arrow
just
as
megissogwon
stooping
raised
a
heavy
stone
to
throw
it
full
upon
the
crown
it
struck
him
at
the
roots
of
his
long
tresses
and
he
reeled
and
staggered
forward
plunging
like
a
wounded
bison
yes
like
pezhekee
the
bison
when
the
snow
is
on
the
prairie
swifter
flew
the
second
arrow
in
the
pathway
of
the
other
piercing
deeper
than
the
other
wounding
sorer
than
the
other
and
the
knees
of
megissogwon
shook
like
windy
reeds
beneath
him
bent
and
trembled
like
the
rushes
but
the
third
and
latest
arrow
swiftest
flew
and
wounded
sorest
and
the
mighty
megissogwon
saw
the
fiery
eyes
of
pauguk
saw
the
eyes
of
death
glare
at
him
heard
his
voice
call
in
the
darkness
at
the
feet
of
hiawatha
lifeless
lay
the
great
lay
the
mightiest
of
magicians
then
the
grateful
hiawatha
called
the
mama
the
woodpecker
from
his
perch
among
the
branches
of
the
melancholy
and
in
honor
of
his
service
stained
with
blood
the
tuft
of
feathers
on
the
little
head
of
mama
even
to
this
day
he
wears
it
wears
the
tuft
of
crimson
feathers
as
a
symbol
of
his
service
then
he
stripped
the
shirt
of
wampum
from
the
back
of
megissogwon
as
a
trophy
of
the
battle
as
a
signal
of
his
conquest
on
the
shore
he
left
the
body
half
on
land
and
half
in
water
in
the
sand
his
feet
were
buried
and
his
face
was
in
the
water
and
above
him
wheeled
and
clamored
the
keneu
the
great
sailing
round
in
narrower
circles
hovering
nearer
nearer
nearer
from
the
wigwam
hiawatha
bore
the
wealth
of
megissogwon
all
his
wealth
of
skins
and
wampum
furs
of
bison
and
of
beaver
furs
of
sable
and
of
ermine
wampum
belts
and
strings
and
pouches
quivers
wrought
with
beads
of
wampum
filled
with
arrows
homeward
then
he
sailed
exulting
homeward
through
the
black
homeward
through
the
weltering
serpents
with
the
trophies
of
the
battle
with
a
shout
and
song
of
triumph
on
the
shore
stood
old
nokomis
on
the
shore
stood
chibiabos
and
the
very
strong
man
kwasind
waiting
for
the
hero
coming
listening
to
his
songs
of
triumph
and
the
people
of
the
village
welcomed
him
with
songs
and
dances
made
a
joyous
feast
and
shouted
honor
be
to
hiawatha
he
has
slain
the
great
slain
the
mightiest
of
magicians
him
who
sent
the
fiery
fever
sent
the
white
fog
from
the
sent
disease
and
death
among
us
ever
dear
to
hiawatha
was
the
memory
of
mama
and
in
token
of
his
friendship
as
a
mark
of
his
remembrance
he
adorned
and
decked
his
with
the
crimson
tuft
of
feathers
with
the
crest
of
mama
but
the
wealth
of
megissogwon
all
the
trophies
of
the
battle
he
divided
with
his
people
shared
it
equally
among
them
x
hiawatha
wooing
as
unto
the
bow
the
cord
is
so
unto
the
man
is
woman
though
she
bends
him
she
obeys
him
though
she
draws
him
yet
she
follows
useless
each
without
the
other
thus
the
youthful
hiawatha
said
within
himself
and
pondered
much
perplexed
by
various
feelings
listless
longing

forever
thus
departed
hiawatha
to
the
land
of
the
dacotahs
to
the
land
of
handsome
women
striding
over
moor
and
meadow
through
interminable
forests
through
uninterrupted
silence
with
his
moccasins
of
magic
at
each
stride
a
mile
he
measured
yet
the
way
seemed
long
before
him
and
his
heart
outran
his
footsteps
and
he
journeyed
without
resting
till
he
heard
the
cataract
laughter
heard
the
falls
of
minnehaha
calling
to
him
through
the
silence
pleasant
is
the
sound
he
murmured
pleasant
is
the
voice
that
calls
me
on
the
outskirts
of
the
forests
the
shadow
and
the
sunshine
herds
of
fallow
deer
were
feeding
but
they
saw
not
hiawatha
to
his
bow
he
whispered
fail
not
to
his
arrow
whispered
swerve
not
sent
it
singing
on
its
errand
to
the
red
heart
of
the
roebuck
threw
the
deer
across
his
shoulder
and
sped
forward
without
pausing
at
the
doorway
of
his
wigwam
sat
the
ancient
in
the
land
of
the
dacotahs
making
of
jasper
of
chalcedony
at
his
side
in
all
her
beauty
sat
the
lovely
minnehaha
sat
his
daughter
laughing
water
plaiting
mats
of
flags
and
rushes
of
the
past
the
old
man
thoughts
were
and
the
maiden
of
the
future
he
was
thinking
as
he
sat
there
of
the
days
when
with
such
arrows
he
had
struck
the
deer
and
bison
on
the
muskoday
the
meadow
shot
the
wild
goose
flying
southward
on
the
wing
the
clamorous
wawa
thinking
of
the
great
how
they
came
to
buy
his
arrows
could
not
fight
without
his
arrows
ah
no
more
such
noble
warriors
could
be
found
on
earth
as
they
were
now
the
men
were
all
like
women
only
used
their
tongues
for
weapons
she
was
thinking
of
a
hunter
from
another
tribe
and
country
young
and
tall
and
very
handsome
who
one
morning
in
the
came
to
buy
her
father
arrows
sat
and
rested
in
the
wigwam
lingered
long
about
the
doorway
looking
back
as
he
departed
she
had
heard
her
father
praise
him
praise
his
courage
and
his
wisdom
would
he
come
again
for
arrows
to
the
falls
of
minnehaha
on
the
mat
her
hands
lay
idle
and
her
eyes
were
very
dreamy
through
their
thoughts
they
heard
a
footstep
heard
a
rustling
in
the
branches
and
with
glowing
cheek
and
forehead
with
the
deer
upon
his
shoulders
suddenly
from
out
the
woodlands
hiawatha
stood
before
them
straight
the
ancient
looked
up
gravely
from
his
labor
laid
aside
the
unfinished
arrow
bade
him
enter
at
the
doorway
saying
as
he
rose
to
meet
him
hiawatha
you
are
welcome
at
the
feet
of
laughing
water
hiawatha
laid
his
burden
threw
the
red
deer
from
his
shoulders
and
the
maiden
looked
up
at
him
looked
up
from
her
mat
of
rushes
said
with
gentle
look
and
accent
you
are
welcome
hiawatha
very
spacious
was
the
wigwam
made
of
dressed
and
whitened
with
the
gods
of
the
dacotahs
drawn
and
painted
on
its
curtains
and
so
tall
the
doorway
hardly
hiawatha
stooped
to
enter
hardly
touched
his
as
he
entered
at
the
doorway
then
uprose
the
laughing
water
from
the
ground
fair
minnehaha
laid
aside
her
mat
unfinished
brought
forth
food
and
set
before
them
water
brought
them
from
the
brooklet
gave
them
food
in
earthen
vessels
gave
them
drink
in
bowls
of
listened
while
the
guest
was
speaking
listened
while
her
father
answered
but
not
once
her
lips
she
opened
not
a
single
word
she
uttered
yes
as
in
a
dream
she
listened
to
the
words
of
hiawatha
as
he
talked
of
old
nokomis
who
had
nursed
him
in
his
childhood
as
he
told
of
his
companions
chibiabos
the
musician
and
the
very
strong
man
kwasind
and
of
happiness
and
plenty
in
the
land
of
the
ojibways
in
the
pleasant
land
and
peaceful
after
many
years
of
warfare
many
years
of
strife
and
bloodshed
there
is
peace
between
the
ojibways
and
the
tribe
of
the
dacotahs
thus
continued
hiawatha
and
then
added
speaking
slowly
that
this
peace
may
last
forever
and
our
hands
be
clasped
more
closely
and
our
hearts
be
more
united
give
me
as
my
wife
this
maiden
minnehaha
laughing
water
loveliest
of
dacotah
women
and
the
ancient
paused
a
moment
ere
he
answered
smoked
a
little
while
in
silence
looked
at
hiawatha
proudly
fondly
looked
at
laughing
water
and
made
answer
very
gravely
yes
if
minnehaha
wishes
let
your
heart
speak
minnehaha
and
the
lovely
laughing
water
seemed
more
lovely
as
she
stood
there
neither
willing
nor
reluctant
as
she
went
to
hiawatha
softly
took
the
seat
beside
him
while
she
said
and
blushed
to
say
it
i
will
follow
you
my
husband
this
was
hiawatha
wooing
thus
it
was
he
won
the
daughter
of
the
ancient
in
the
land
of
the
dacotahs
from
the
wigwam
he
departed
leading
with
him
laughing
water
hand
in
hand
they
went
together
through
the
woodland
and
the
meadow
left
the
old
man
standing
lonely
at
the
doorway
of
his
wigwam
heard
the
falls
of
minnehaha
calling
to
them
from
the
distance
crying
to
them
from
afar
off
fare
thee
well
o
minnehaha
and
the
ancient
turned
again
unto
his
labor
sat
down
by
his
sunny
doorway
murmuring
to
himself
and
saying
thus
it
is
our
daughters
leave
us
those
we
love
and
those
who
love
us
just
when
they
have
learned
to
help
us

we
are
old
and
lean
upon
them
comes
a
youth
with
flaunting
feathers
with
his
flute
of
reeds
a
stranger
wanders
piping
through
the
village
beckons
to
the
fairest
maiden
and
she
follows
where
he
leads
her
leaving
all
things
for
the
stranger
pleasant
was
the
journey
homeward
through
interminable
forests
over
meadow
over
mountain
over
river
hill
and
hollow
short
it
seemed
to
hiawatha
though
they
journeyed
very
slowly
though
his
pace
he
checked
and
slackened
to
the
steps
of
laughing
water
over
wide
and
rushing
rivers
in
his
arms
he
bore
the
maiden
light
he
thought
her
as
a
feather
as

boasting
would
you
only
give
him
credence
no
one
ever
shot
an
arrow
half
so
far
and
high
as
he
had
ever
caught
so
many
fishes
ever
killed
so
many
reindeer
ever
trapped
so
many
beaver
none
could
run
so
fast
as
he
could
none
could
dive
so
deep
as
he
could
none
could
swim
so
far
as
he
could
none
had
made
so
many
journeys
none
had
seen
so
many
wonders
as
this
wonderful
iagoo
as
this
marvellous
thus
his
name
became
a
and
a
jest
among
the
people
and
a
boastful
hunter
praised
his
own
address
too
highly
or
a
warrior
home
returning
talked
too
much
of
his
achievements
all
his
hearers
cried
iagoo
here
iagoo
come
among
us
he
it
was
who
carved
the
cradle
of
the
little
hiawatha
carved
its
framework
out
of
linden
bound
it
strong
with
reindeer
sinews
he
it
was
who
taught
him
later
how
to
make
his
bows
and
arrows
how
to
make
the
bows
of
and
the
arrows
of
the
so
among
the
guests
assembled
at
my
hiawatha
wedding
sat
iagoo
old
and
ugly
sat
the
marvellous
and
they
said
o
good
iagoo
tell
us
now
a
tale
of
wonder
tell
us
of
some
strange
adventure
that
the
feast
may
be
more
joyous
that
the
time
may
pass
more
gayly
and
our
guests
be
more
contented
and
iagoo
answered
straightway
you
shall
hear
a
tale
of
wonder
you
shall
hear
the
strange
adventures
of
osseo
the
magician
from
the
evening
star
descending
xii
the
son
of
the
evening
star
can
it
be
the
sun
descending
the
level
plain
of
water
or
the
red
swan
floating
flying
wounded
by
the
magic
arrow
staining
all
the
waves
with
crimson
with
the
crimson
of
its
filling
all
the
air
with
splendor
with
the
splendor
of
its
plumage
yes
it
is
the
sun
descending
sinking
down
into
the
water
all
the
sky
is
stained
with
purple
all
the
water
flushed
with
crimson
no
it
is
the
red
swan
floating
diving
down
beneath
the
water
to
the
sky
its
wings
are
lifted
with
its
blood
the
waves
are
reddened
over
it
the
star
of
evening
melts
and
trembles
through
the
purple
hangs
suspended
in
the
twilight
no
it
is
a
bead
of
wampum
on
the
robes
of
the
great
spirit
as
he
passes
through
the
twilight
walks
in
silence
through
the
heavens
this
with
joy
beheld
iagoo
and
he
said
in
haste
behold
it
see
the
sacred
star
of
evening
you
shall
hear
a
tale
of
wonder
hear
the
story
of
osseo
son
of
the
evening
star
osseo
once
in
days
no
more
remembered
ages
nearer
the
beginning
when
the
heavens
were
closer
to
us
and
the
gods
were
more
familiar
in
the
lived
a
hunter
with
ten
young
and
comely
daughters
tall
and
lithe
as
wands
of
willow
only
oweenee
the
youngest
she
the
wilful
and
the
wayward
she
the
silent
dreamy
maiden
was
the
fairest
of
the
sisters
all
these
women
married
warriors
married
brave
and
haughty
husbands
only
oweenee
the
youngest
laughed
and
flouted
all
her
lovers
all
her
young
and
handsome
suitors
and
then
married
old
osseo
old
osseo
poor
and
ugly
broken
with
age
and
weak
with
coughing
always
coughing
like
a
squirrel
ah
but
beautiful
within
him
was
the
spirit
of
osseo
from
the
evening
star
descended
star
of
evening
star
of
woman
star
of
tenderness
and
passion
all
its
fire
was
in
his
bosom
all
its
beauty
in
his
spirit
all
its
mystery
in
his
being
all
its
splendor
in
his
language
and
her
lovers
the
rejected
handsome
men
with
belts
of
wampum
handsome
men
with
paint
and
feathers
pointed
at
her
in
derision
followed
her
with
jest
and
laughter
but
she
said
care
not
for
you
care
not
for
your
belts
of
wampum
care
not
for
your
paint
and
feathers
care
not
for
your
jests
and
laughter
i
am
happy
with
osseo
once
to
some
great
feast
invited
through
the
damp
and
dusk
of
evening
walked
together
the
ten
sisters
walked
together
with
their
husbands
slowly
followed
old
osseo
with
fair
oweenee
beside
him
all
the
others
chatted
gayly
these
two
only
walked
in
silence
at
the
western
sky
osseo
gazed
intent
as
if
imploring
often
stopped
and
gazed
imploring
at
the
trembling
star
of
evening
at
the
tender
star
of
woman
and
they
heard
him
murmur
softly
showain
nemeshin
nosa
pity
pity
me
my
father
said
the
eldest
sister
is
praying
to
his
father
what
a
pity
that
the
old
man
does
not
stumble
in
the
pathway
does
not
break
his
neck
by
falling
and
they
laughed
till
all
the
forest
rang
with
their
unseemly
laughter
on
their
pathway
through
the
woodlands
lay
an
oak
by
storms
uprooted
lay
the
great
trunk
of
an
buried
half
in
leaves
and
mosses
mouldering
crumbling
huge
and
hollow
and
osseo
when
he
saw
it
gave
a
shout
a
cry
of
anguish
leaped
into
its
yawning
cavern
at
one
end
went
in
an
old
man
wasted
wrinkled
old
and
ugly
from
the
other
came
a
young
man
tall
and
straight
and
strong
and
handsome
thus
osseo
was
transfigured
thus
restored
to
youth
and
beauty
but
alas
for
good
osseo
and
for
oweenee
the
faithful
strangely
too
was
she
transfigured
changed
into
a
weak
old
woman
with
a
staff
she
tottered
onward
wasted
wrinkled
old
and
ugly
and
the
sisters
and
their
husbands
laughed
until
the
echoing
forest
rang
with
their
unseemly
laughter
but
osseo
turned
not
from
her
walked
with
slower
step
beside
her
took
her
hand
as
brown
and
withered
as
an
is
in
winter
called
her
sweetheart
nenemoosha
soothed
her
with
soft
words
of
kindness
till
they
reached
the
lodge
of
feasting
till
they
sat
down
in
the
wigwam
sacred
to
the
star
of
evening
to
the
tender
star
of
woman
wrapt
in
visions
lost
in
dreaming
at
the
banquet
sat
osseo
all
were
merry
all
were
happy
all
were
joyous
but
osseo
neither
food
nor
drink
he
tasted
neither
did
he
speak
nor
listen
but
as
one
bewildered
sat
he
looking
dreamily
and
sadly
first
at
oweenee
then
upward
at
the
gleaming
sky
above
them
then
a
voice
was
heard
a
whisper
coming
from
the
starry
distance
coming
from
the
empty
vastness
low
and
musical
and
tender
and
the
voice
said
osseo
o
my
son
my
best
beloved
broken
are
the
spells
that
bound
you
all
the
charms
of
the
magicians
all
the
magic
powers
of
evil
come
to
me
ascend
osseo
the
food
that
stands
before
you
it
is
blessed
and
enchanted
it
has
magic
virtues
in
it
it
will
change
you
to
a
spirit
all
your
bowls
and
all
your
kettles
shall
be
wood
and
clay
no
longer
but
the
bowls
be
changed
to
wampum
and
the
kettles
shall
be
silver
they
shall
shine
like
shells
of
scarlet
like
the
fire
shall
gleam
and
glimmer
the
women
shall
no
longer
bear
the
dreary
doom
of
labor
but
be
changed
to
birds
and
glisten
with
the
beauty
of
the
starlight
painted
with
the
dusky
splendors
of
the
skies
and
clouds
of
evening
what
osseo
heard
as
whispers
what
as
words
he
comprehended
was
but
music
to
the
others
music
as
of
birds
afar
off
of
the
whippoorwill
afar
off
of
the
lonely
wawonaissa
singing
in
the
darksome
forest
then
the
lodge
began
to
tremble
straight
began
to
shake
and
tremble
and
they
felt
it
rising
rising
slowly
through
the
air
ascending
from
the
darkness
of
the
forth
into
the
dewy
starlight
till
it
passed
the
topmost
branches
and
behold
the
wooden
dishes
all
were
changed
to
shells
of
scarlet
and
behold
the
earthen
kettles
all
were
changed
to
bowls
of
silver
and
the
of
the
wigwam
were
as
glittering
rods
of
silver
and
the
roof
of
bark
upon
them
as
the
shining
shards
of
beetles
then
osseo
gazed
around
him
and
he
saw
the
nine
fair
sisters
all
the
sisters
and
their
husbands
changed
to
birds
of
various
plumage
some
were
jays
and
some
were
magpies
others
thrushes
others
blackbirds
and
they
hopped
and
sang
and
twittered
perked
and
fluttered
all
their
feathers
strutted
in
their
shining
plumage
and
their
tails
like
fans
unfolded
only
oweenee
the
youngest
was
not
changed
but
sat
in
silence
wasted
wrinkled
old
and
ugly
looking
sadly
at
the
others
till
osseo
gazing
upward
gave
another
cry
of
anguish
such
a
cry
as
he
had
uttered
by
the
in
the
forest
then
returned
her
youth
and
beauty
and
her
soiled
and
tattered
garments
were
transformed
to
robes
of
ermine
and
her
staff
became
a
feather
yes
a
shining
silver
feather
and
again
the
wigwam
trembled
swayed
and
rushed
through
airy
currents
through
transparent
cloud
and
vapor
and
amid
celestial
splendors
on
the
evening
star
alighted
as
a
falls
on
as
a
leaf
drops
on
a
river
as
the
thistledown
on
water
forth
with
cheerful
words
of
welcome
came
the
father
of
osseo
he
with
radiant
locks
of
silver
he
with
eyes
serene
and
tender
and
he
said
son
osseo
hang
the
cage
of
birds
you
bring
there
hang
the
cage
with
rods
of
silver
and
the
birds
with
glistening
feathers
at
the
doorway
of
my
wigwam
at
the
door
he
hung
the
and
they
entered
in
and
gladly
listened
to
osseo
father
ruler
of
the
star
of
evening
as
he
said
my
osseo
i
have
had
compassion
on
you
given
you
back
your
youth
and
beauty
into
birds
of
various
plumage
changed
your
sisters
and
their
husbands
changed
them
thus
because
they
mocked
you
in
the
figure
of
the
old
man
in
that
aspect
sad
and
wrinkled
could
not
see
your
heart
of
passion
could
not
see
your
youth
immortal
only
oweenee
the
faithful
saw
your
naked
heart
and
loved
you
the
lodge
that
glimmers
yonder
in
the
little
star
that
twinkles
through
the
vapors
on
the
left
hand
lives
the
envious
evil
spirit
the
wabeno
the
magician
who
transformed
you
to
an
old
man
take
heed
lest
his
beams
fall
on
you
for
the
rays
he
darts
around
him
are
the
power
of
his
enchantment
are
the
arrows
that
he
uses
many
years
in
peace
and
quiet
on
the
peaceful
star
of
evening
dwelt
osseo
with
his
father
many
years
in
song
and
flutter
at
the
doorway
of
the
wigwam
hung
the
cage
with
rods
of
silver
and
fair
oweenee
the
faithful
bore
a
son
unto
osseo
with
the
beauty
of
his
mother
with
the
courage
of
his
father
and
the
boy
grew
up
and
prospered
and
osseo
to
delight
him
made
him
little
bows
and
arrows
opened
the
great
cage
of
silver
and
let
loose
his
aunts
and
uncles
all
those
birds
with
glossy
feathers
for
his
little
son
to
shoot
at
round
and
round
they
wheeled
and
darted
filled
the
evening
star
with
music
with
their
songs
of
joy
and
freedom
filled
the
evening
star
with
splendor
with
the
fluttering
of
their
plumage
till
the
boy
the
little
hunter
bent
his
bow
and
shot
an
arrow
shot
a
swift
and
fatal
arrow
and
a
bird
with
shining
feathers
at
his
feet
fell
wounded
sorely
but
o
wondrous
transformation
was
no
bird
he
saw
before
him
was
a
beautiful
young
woman
with
the
arrow
in
her
bosom
when
her
blood
fell
on
the
planet
on
the
sacred
star
of
evening
broken
was
the
spell
of
magic
powerless
was
the
strange
enchantment
and
the
youth
the
fearless
bowman
suddenly
felt
himself
descending
held
by
unseen
hands
but
sinking
downward
through
the
empty
spaces
downward
through
the
clouds
and
vapors
till
he
rested
on
an
island
on
an
island
green
and
grassy
yonder
in
the
after
him
he
saw
descending
all
the
birds
with
shining
feathers
fluttering
falling
wafted
downward
like
the
painted
leaves
of
autumn
and
the
lodge
with
poles
of
silver
with
its
roof
like
wings
of
beetles
like
the
shining
shards
of
beetles
by
the
winds
of
heaven
uplifted
slowly
sank
upon
the
island
bringing
back
the
good
osseo
bringing
oweenee
the
faithful
then
the
birds
again
transfigured
reassumed
the
shape
of
mortals
took
their
shape
but
not
their
stature
they
remained
as
little
people
like
the
pygmies
the
and
on
pleasant
nights
of
summer
when
the
evening
star
was
shining
hand
in
hand
they
danced
together
on
the
island
craggy
headlands
on
the
low
and
level
still
their
glittering
lodge
is
seen
there
on
the
tranquil
summer
evenings
and
upon
the
shore
the
fisher
sometimes
hears
their
happy
voices
sees
them
dancing
in
the
starlight
when
the
story
was
completed
when
the
wondrous
tale
was
ended
looking
round
upon
his
listeners
solemnly
iagoo
added
there
are
great
men
i
have
known
such
whom
their
people
understand
not
whom
they
even
make
a
jest
of
scoff
and
jeer
at

derision
from
the
story
of
osseo
let
us
learn
the
fate
of
jesters
all
the
wedding
guests

listened
to
the
marvellous
story

laughing
and
applauding
and
they
whispered
to
each
other
does
he
mean
himself
i
wonder
and
are
we
the
aunts
and
uncles
then
again
sang
chibiabos
sang
a
song
of
love
and
longing
in
those
accents
sweet
and
tender
in
those
tones
of
pensive
sadness
sang
a
maiden
lamentation
for
her

algonquin

planted
round

cornfields
covered
by
your

as

the

with

the
plots
of
hiawatha
when
the
noiseless
night
descended

and
dark
field
and
forest
when
the
mournful
wawonaissa
sorrowing
sang
among
the
hemlocks
and
the
spirit
of
sleep
nepahwin
shut
the
doors
of
all
the
wigwams
from

bed
rose
laughing
water
laid
aside
her
garments
wholly
and
with
darkness
clothed
and
guarded
unashamed
and
unaffrighted
walked
securely
round
the
cornfields
drew
the
sacred
magic
circle
of
her
footprints
round
the
cornfields
no
one
but
the
midnight
only
saw
her
beauty
in
the
darkness
no
one
but
the
wawonaissa
heard
the
panting
of
her
bosom
guskewau
the
darkness
wrapped
her
closely
in
his
sacred
mantle
so
that
none
might
see
her
beauty
so
that
none
might
boast
i
saw
her
on
the
morrow
as
the
day
dawned
kahgahgee
the
king
of
ravens
gathered
all
his
black
marauders
crows
and
blackbirds
jays
and
ravens
clamorous
on
the
dusky
and
descended
fast
and
fearless
on
the
fields
of
hiawatha
on
the
grave
of
the
mondamin
we
will
drag
mondamin
said
they
from
the
grave
where
he
is
buried
spite
of
all
the
magic
circles
laughing
water
draws
around
it
spite
of
all
the
sacred
footprints
minnehaha
stamps
upon
it
but
the
wary
hiawatha
ever
thoughtful
careful
watchful
had
the
scornful
laughter
when
they
mocked
him
from
the
kaw
he
said
my
friends
the
ravens
kahgahgee
my
king
of
ravens
i
will
teach
you
all
a
lesson
that
shall
not
be
soon
forgotten
he
had
risen
before
the
daybreak
he
had
spread
all
the
cornfields
snares
to
catch
the
black
marauders
and
was
lying
now
in
ambush
in
the
neighboring
grove
of
waiting
for
the
crows
and
blackbirds
waiting
for
the
jays
and
ravens
soon
they
came
with
caw
and
clamor
rush
of
wings
and
cry
of
voices
to
their
work
of
devastation
settling
down
upon
the
cornfields
delving
deep
with
beak
and
talon
for
the
body
of
mondamin
and
with
all
their
craft
and
cunning
all
their
skill
in
wiles
of
warfare
they
perceived
no
danger
near
them
till
their
claws
became
entangled
till
they
found
themselves
imprisoned
in
the
snares
of
hiawatha
from
his
place
of
ambush
came
he
striding
terrible
among
them
and
so
awful
was
his
aspect
that
the
bravest
quailed
with
terror
without
mercy
he
destroyed
them
right
and
left
by
tens
and
twenties
and
their
wretched
lifeless
bodies
hung
aloft
on
poles
for
scarecrows
round
the
consecrated
cornfields
as
a
signal
of
his
vengeance
as
a
warning
to
marauders
only
kahgahgee
the
leader
kahgahgee
the
king
of
ravens
he
alone
was
spared
among
them
as
a
hostage
for
his
people
with
his
he
bound
him
led
him
captive
to
his
wigwam
tied
him
fast
with
cords
of
to
the
of
his
wigwam
kahgahgee
my
raven
said
he
you
the
leader
of
the
robbers
you

of
this
mischief
the
contriver
of
this
outrage
i
will
keep
you
i
will
hold
you
as
a
hostage
for
your
people
as
a
pledge
of
good
behavior
and
he
left
him
grim
and
sulky
sitting
in
the
morning
sunshine
on
the
summit
of
the
wigwam
croaking
fiercely
his
displeasure
flapping
his
great
sable
pinions
vainly
struggling
for
his
freedom
vainly
calling
on
his
people
summer
passed
and
shawondasee
breathed
his
sighs
all
the
landscape
from
the
sent
his
ardor
wafted
kisses
warm
and
tender
and
the
grew
and
ripened
till
it
stood
in
all
the
splendor
of
its
garments
green
and
yellow
of
its
tassels
and
its
plumage
and
the
full
and
shining
gleamed
from
bursting
sheaths
of
verdure
then
nokomis
the
old
woman
spake
and
said
to
minnehaha
is
the
moon
when
leaves
are
falling
all
the
wild
rice
has
been
gathered
and
the
maize
is
ripe
and
ready
let
us
gather
in
the
harvest
let
us
wrestle
with
mondamin
strip
him
of
his
plumes
and
tassels
of
his
garments
green
and
yellow
and
the
merry
laughing
water
went
rejoicing
from
the
wigwam
with
nokomis
old
and
wrinkled
and
they
called
the
women
round
them
called
the
young
men
and
the
maidens
to
the
harvest
of
the
cornfields
to
the
husking
of
the
on
the
border
of
the
forest
underneath
the
fragrant
sat
the
old
men
and
the
warriors
smoking
in
the
pleasant
shadow
in
uninterrupted
silence
looked
they
at
the
gamesome
labor
of
the
young
men
and
the
women
listened
to
their
noisy
talking
to
their
laughter
and
their
singing
heard
them
chattering
like
the
magpies
heard
them
laughing
like
the
heard
them
singing
like
the
robins
and
some
lucky
maiden
found
a
red
ear
in
the
husking
found
a
red
as
blood
is
nushka
cried
they
all
together
nushka
you
shall
have
a
sweetheart
you
shall
have
a
handsome
husband
ugh
the
old
men
all
responded
from
their
seats
beneath
the
and
a
youth
or
maiden
found
a
crooked
ear
in
husking
found
a
in
the
husking
blighted
mildewed
or
misshapen
then
they
laughed
and
sang
together
crept
and
limped
about
the
cornfields
mimicked
in
their
gait
and
gestures
some
old
man
bent
almost
double
singing
singly
or
together
wagemin
the
thief
of
cornfields
paimosaid
who
steals
the
till
the
cornfields
rang
with
laughter
till
from

kahgahgee
the
king
of
ravens
screamed
and
quivered
in
his
anger
and
from
all
the
neighboring
cawed
and
croaked
the
black
marauders
ugh
the
old
men
all
responded
from
their
seats
beneath
the
xiv
in
those
days
said
hiawatha
lo
how
all
things
fade
and
perish
from
the
memory
of
the
old

pass
away
the
great

thus
said
hiawatha
walking
in
the
solitary
forest
pondering
musing
in
the
forest
on
the
welfare
of
his
people
from
his
pouch
he
took
his
colors
took
his
paints
of
different
colors
on
the
smooth
bark
of
a
painted
many
shapes
and
figures
wonderful
and
mystic
figures
and
each
figure
had
a
meaning
each
some
word
or
thought
suggested
gitche
manito
the
mighty
he
the
master
of
life
was
painted
as
an
egg
with
points
projecting
to
the
four
winds
of
the
heavens
everywhere
is
the
great
spirit
was
the
meaning
of
this
symbol
mitche
manito
the
mighty
he
the
dreadful
spirit
of
evil
as
a
serpent
was
depicted
as
kenabeek
the
great
serpent
very
crafty
very
cunning
is
the
creeping
spirit
of
evil
was
the
meaning
of
this
symbol
life
and
death
he
drew
as
circles
life
was
white
but
death
was
darkened
sun
and
moon
and
stars
he
painted
man
and
beast
and
fish
and
reptile
forests
mountains
lakes
and
rivers
for
the
earth
he
drew
a
straight
line
for
the
sky
a
bow
above
it
white
the
space
between
for
daytime
filled
with
little
stars
for
on
the
left
a
point
for
sunrise
on
the
right
a
point
for
sunset
on
the
top
a
point
for
noontide
and
for
rain
and
cloudy
weather
waving
lines
descending
from
it
footprints
pointing
towards
a
wigwam
were
a
sign
of
invitation
were
a
sign
of
guests
assembling
bloody
hands
with
palms
uplifted
were
a
symbol
of
destruction
were
a
hostile
sign
and
symbol
all
these
things
did
hiawatha
show
unto
his
wondering
people
and
interpreted
their
meaning
and
he
said
behold
your
have
no
mark
no
sign
nor
symbol
go
and
paint
them
all
with
figures
each
one
with
its
household
symbol
with
its
own
ancestral
totem
so
that
those
who
follow
after
may
distinguish
them
and
know
them
and
they
painted
on
the
on
the
graves
yet
unforgotten
each
his
own
ancestral
totem
each
the
symbol
of
his
household
figures
of
the
bear
and
reindeer
of
the
turtle
crane
and
beaver
each
inverted
as
a
token
that
the
owner
was
departed
that
the
chief
who
bore
the
symbol
lay
beneath
in
dust
and
ashes
and
the
jossakeeds
the
prophets
the
wabenos
the
magicians
and
the
the
medas
painted
upon
bark
and
figures
for
the
songs
they
chanted
for
each
song
a
separate
symbol
figures
mystical
and
awful
figures
strange
and
brightly
colored
and
each
figure
had
its
meaning
each
some
magic
song
suggested
the
great
spirit
the
creator
flashing
light
through
all
the
heaven
the
great
serpent
the
kenabeek
with
his
bloody
crest
erected
creeping
looking
into
heaven
in
the
sky
the
sun
that
listens
and
the
moon
eclipsed
and
dying
owl
and
eagle
crane
and
and
the
cormorant
bird
of
magic
headless
men
that
walk
the
heavens
bodies
lying
pierced
with
arrows
bloody
hands
of
death
uplifted
flags
on
graves
and
great
grasping
both
the
earth
and
heaven
such
as
these
the
shapes
they
painted
on
the
and
the
songs
of
war
and
songs
of
hunting
songs
of
medicine
and
of
magic
all
were
written
in
these
figures
for
each
figure
had
its
meaning
each
its
separate
song
recorded
nor
forgotten
was
the
the
most
subtle
of
all
medicines
the
most
potent
spell
of
magic
dangerous
more
than
war
or
hunting
thus
the
was
recorded
symbol
and
interpretation
first
a
human
figure
standing
painted
in
the
brightest
scarlet
is
the
lover
the
musician
and
the
meaning
is
my
painting
makes
me
powerful
over
others
then
the
figure
seated
singing
playing
on
a
drum
of
magic
and
the
interpretation
listen
is
my
voice
you
hear
my
singing
then
the
same
red
figure
seated
in
the
shelter
of
a
wigwam
and
the
meaning
of
the
symbol
i
will
come
and
sit
beside
you
in
the
mystery
of
my
passion
then
two
figures
man
and
woman
standing
hand
in
hand
together
with
their
hands
so
clasped
together
that
they
seemed
in
one
united
and
the
words
thus
represented
are
i
see
your
heart
within
you
and
your
cheeks
are
red
with
blushes
next
the
maiden
on
an
island
in
the
centre
of
an
island
and
the
song
this
shape
suggested
was
though
you
were
at
a
distance
were
upon
some
island
such
the
spell
i
cast
upon
you
such
the
magic
power
of
passion
i
could
straightway
draw
you
to
me
then
the
figure
of
the
maiden
sleeping
and
the
lover
near
her
whispering
to
her
in
her
slumbers
saying
though
you
were
far
from
me
in
the
land
of
sleep
and
silence
still
the
voice
of
love
would
reach
you
and
the
last
of
all
the
figures
was
a
heart
within
a
circle
drawn
within
a
magic
circle
and
the
image
had
this
meaning
naked
lies
your
heart
before
me
to
your
naked
heart
i
whisper
thus
it
was
that
hiawatha
in
his
wisdom
taught
the
people
all
the
mysteries
of
painting
all
the
art
of
on
the
smooth
bark
of
the
on
the
white
skin
of
the
reindeer
on
the
of
the
village
xv
hiawatha
lamentation
in
those
days
the
evil
spirits
all
the
manitos
of
mischief
fearing
hiawatha
wisdom
and
his
love
for
chibiabos
jealous
of
their
faithful
friendship
and
their
noble
words
and
actions
made
at
length
a
league
against
them
to
molest
them
and
destroy
them
hiawatha
wise
and
wary
often
said
to
chibiabos
o
my
brother
do
not
leave
me
lest
the
evil
spirits
harm
you
chibiabos
young
and
heedless
laughing
shook
his
tresses
answered
ever
sweet
and
childlike
do
not
fear
for
me
o
brother
harm
and
evil
come
not
near
me
once
when
peboan
the
winter
roofed
with
ice
the
when
the
whirling
downward
hissed
among
the
withered
changed
the
into
wigwams
covered
all
the
earth
with
silence
armed
with
arrows
shod
with
heeding
not
his
brother
warning
fearing
not
the
evil
spirits
forth
to
hunt
the
deer
with
antlers
all
alone
went
chibiabos
right
across
the
sprang
with
speed
the
deer
before
him
with
the
wind
and
snow
he
followed
the
treacherous
ice
he
followed
wild
with
all
the
fierce
commotion
and
the
rapture
of
the
hunting
but
beneath
the
evil
spirits
lay
in
ambush
waiting
for
him
broke
the
treacherous
ice
beneath
him
dragged
him
downward
to
the
bottom
buried
in
the
sand
his
body
unktahee
the

of

he
the
god
of
the
dacotahs
drowned
him
in
the
deep
abysses
of
the
lake
of
gitche
gumee
from
the
headlands
hiawatha
sent
forth
such
a
wail
of
anguish
such
a
fearful
lamentation
that
the
bison
paused
to
listen
and
the
wolves
howled
from
the
prairies
and
the
thunder
in
the
distance
starting
answered
then
his
face
with
black
he
painted
with
his
robe
his
head
he
covered
in
his
wigwam
sat
lamenting
seven
long
weeks
he
sat
lamenting
uttering
still
this
moan
of
sorrow
he
is
dead
the
sweet
musician
he
the
sweetest
of
all
singers
he
has
gone
from
us
forever
he
has
moved
a
little
nearer
to
the
master
of
all
music
to
the
master
of
all
singing
o
my
brother
chibiabos
and
the
melancholy
waved
their
dark
green
fans
above
him
waved
their
purple
cones
above
him
sighing
with
him
to
console
him
mingling
with
his
lamentation
their
complaining
their
lamenting
came
the
spring
and
all
the
forest
looked
in
vain
for
chibiabos
sighed
the

answered
but
his
mournful
head
uncovered
from

face
the
mourning
colors
washed
he
slowly
and
in
silence
slowly
and
in
silence
followed
onward
to
the
sacred
wigwam
there

gave
him

danced
their
around

and
upstarting
wild
and
haggard
like
a
man
from
dreams
awakened
he
was
healed
of
all
his
madness
as
the
clouds
are
swept
from
heaven
straightway
from
his
brain
departed
all
his
moody
melancholy
as
the
ice
is
swept
from
rivers
straightway
from
his
heart
departed
all
his
sorrow
and
affliction
then
they
summoned
chibiabos
from
his
grave
beneath
the
waters
from
the
sands
of
gitche
gumee
summoned
hiawatha
brother
and
so
mighty
was
the
magic
of
that
cry
and
invocation
that
he
heard
it
as
he
lay
there
underneath
the
from
the
sand
he
rose
and
listened
heard
the
music
and
the
singing
came
obedient
to
the
summons
to
the
doorway
of
the
wigwam
but
to
enter
they
forbade
him
through
a
chink
a
coal
they
gave
him
through
the
door
a
burning
ruler
in
the
land
of
spirits
ruler
the
dead
they
made
him
telling
him
a
fire
to
kindle
for
all
those
that
died
thereafter
for
their
night
encampments
on
their
solitary
journey
to
the
kingdom
of
ponemah
to
the
land
of
the
hereafter
from
the
village
of
his
childhood
from
the
homes
of
those
who
knew
him
passing
silent
through
the
forest
like
a
wafted
sideways
slowly
vanished
chibiabos
where
he
passed
the
branches
moved
not
where
he
trod
the
grasses
bent
not
and
the
fallen
leaves
of
last
year
made
no
sound
beneath
his
footstep
four
whole
days
he
journeyed
onward
down
the
pathway
of
the
dead
men
on
the
strawberry
feasted
crossed
the
melancholy
river
on
the
swinging
log
he
crossed
it
came
unto
the
lake
of
silver
in
the
stone
canoe
was
carried
to
the
islands
of
the
blessed
to
the
land
of
ghosts
and
shadows
on
that
journey
moving
slowly
many
weary
spirits
saw
he
panting
under
heavy
burdens
laden
with
bows
and
arrows
robes
of
fur
and
pots
and
kettles
and
with
food
that
friends
had
given
for
that
solitary
journey

why

the
living
said
they
lay
such
heavy
burdens
on
us
better
were
it
to
go
naked
better
were
it
to
go
fasting
than
to
bear
such
heavy
burdens
on

long
and
weary
journey
forth
then
issued
hiawatha
wandered
eastward
wandered
westward
teaching
men
the
use
of
simples
and
the
antidotes
for
poisons
and
the
cure
of
all
diseases

all
assembled
in
the
lodge
of

monstrous
stories
to
his
wonderful
adventures
he
was
telling
them
the
story
of
ojeeg
the
how
he
made
a
hole
in
heaven
how
he
climbed
up
into
heaven
and
let
out
the
the
perpetual
pleasant
summer
how
the
otter
first
essayed
it
how
the
beaver
lynx
and

tried
in

the
great
achievement
from

summit
of
the
mountain
smote
their
fists
against
the
heavens
smote
against
the
sky
their
foreheads
cracked
the
sky
but
could
not
break
it
how
the
wolverine
uprising
made
him
ready
for
the
encounter
bent
his
knees
down
like
a
squirrel
drew
his
arms
back
like
a
cricket
once
he
leaped
said
old
iagoo
once
he
leaped
and
lo
above
him
bent
the
sky
as
ice
in
rivers
when
the
waters
rise
beneath
it
twice
he
leaped
and
lo
above
him
cracked
the
sky
as
ice
in
rivers
when
the
freshet
is
at
highest
thrice
he
leaped
and
lo
above
him
broke
the
shattered
sky
asunder
and
he
disappeared
within
it
and
ojeeg
the
fisher
weasel
with
a
bound
went
in
behind
him
hark
you
shouted
as
he
entered
at
the
doorway

of

iagoo
stories
tired
of
hiawatha
wisdom
here
is
something
to
amuse
you
better
than
this
endless
talking
then
from
out
his
pouch
of
forth
he
drew
with
solemn
manner

and
explained

running
through
its
various
chances

changes
various
meanings
twenty
curious

of
eagerness

the
people
called
him
as
the
fire
burns
in
a
dusky
red
beneath
the
ashes
so
beneath
his
shaggy
eyebrows
glowed
the
eyes
of
old
iagoo
ugh
he
answered
very
fiercely
ugh
they
answered
all
and
each
one
seized
the
wooden
bowl
the
old
man
closely
in
his
bony
fingers
clutched
the
fatal
bowl
onagon
shook
it
fiercely
and
with
fury
made

smiling
shook

and
threw

in
the
air
he
tossed
them
and
they
fell
about
him
scattered
dark
and
bright
the
ozawabeeks
red
and
white
the
other
pieces
and
upright
among
the
others
one
ininewug
was
standing
even
as
crafty
stood
alone
among
the
players
saying
five
tens
mine
the
game
is
twenty
eyes
glared
at
him
fiercely
like
the
eyes
of
wolves
glared
at
him
as
he
turned
and
left
the
wigwam
followed
by
his
meshinauwa
by
the
nephew
of
iagoo
by
the
tall
and
graceful
stripling
bearing
in

said
pointing
with
his
fan
of
feathers
to
my
wigwam
far
to
eastward
on
the
dunes
of
nagow
wudjoo
hot
and
red
with
smoke
and
gambling
were
the
eyes
of
as
he
came
forth
to
the
freshness
of
the
pleasant
summer
morning
all
the
birds
were
singing
gayly
all
the
streamlets
flowing
swiftly
and
the
heart
of
sang
with
pleasure
as
the
birds
sing
beat
with
triumph
like
the
streamlets
as
he
wandered
through
the
village
in
the
early
gray
of
morning
with
his
fan
of
with
his
plumes
and
tufts
of
swan
down
till
he
reached
the
farthest
wigwam
reached
the
lodge
of
hiawatha
silent
was
it
and
deserted
no
one
met
him
at
the
doorway
no
one
came
to
bid
him
welcome
but
the
birds
were
singing
round
it
in
and
out
and
round
the
doorway
hopping
singing
fluttering
feeding
and
aloft
upon
the
kahgahgee
the
king
of
ravens
sat
with
fiery
eyes
and
screaming
flapped
his
wings
at
all
are
gone
the
lodge
is
empty
thus
it
was
spake
in
his
heart
resolving
mischief
gone
is
wary
hiawatha
gone
the
silly
laughing
water
gone
nokomis
the
old
woman
and
the
lodge
is
left
unguarded
by
the
neck
he
seized
the
raven
whirled
it
round
him
like
a
rattle
like
a
he
shook
it
strangled
kahgahgee
the
raven
from
the
of
the
wigwam
left
its
lifeless
body
hanging
as
an
insult
to
its
master
as
a
taunt
to
hiawatha
with
a
stealthy
step
he
entered
round
the
lodge
in
wild
disorder
threw
the
household
things
about
him
piled
together
in
confusion
bowls
of
wood
and
earthen
kettles
robes
of
buffalo
and
beaver
skins
of
otter
lynx
and
ermine
as
an
insult
to
nokomis
as
a
taunt
to
minnehaha
then
departed
whistling
singing
through
the
forest
whistling
gayly
to
the
squirrels
who
from
hollow
boughs
above
him
dropped
their
upon
him
singing
gayly
to
the
wood
birds
who
from
out
the
leafy
darkness
answered
with
a
song
as
merry
then
he
climbed
the
rocky
headlands
looking
the
gitche
gumee
perched
himself
upon
their
summit
waiting
full
of
mirth
and
mischief
the
return
of
hiawatha
stretched
upon
his
back
he
lay
there
far
below
him
splashed
the
waters
plashed
and
washed
the
dreamy
waters
far
above
him
swam
the
heavens
swam
the
dizzy
dreamy
heavens
round
him
hovered
fluttered
rustled
hiawatha
mountain
chickens
swept
and
wheeled
about
him
almost
brushed
him
with
their
pinions
and
he
killed
them
as
he
lay
there
slaughtered
them
by
tens
and
twenties
threw
their
bodies
down
the
headland
threw
them
on
the
beach
below
him
till
at
length
kayoshk
the
perched
upon
a
crag
above
them
shouted
it
is

slaying

by
hundreds

to
our
brother

to
hiawatha
xvii
the
hunting
of
full
of
wrath
was
hiawatha
when
he
came
into
the
village
found
the
people
in
confusion
heard
of
all
the
misdemeanors
all
the
malice
and
the
mischief
of
the
cunning
hard
his
breath
came
through
his
nostrils
through
his
teeth
he
buzzed
and
muttered
words
of
anger
and
resentment
hot
and
humming
like
a
hornet
i
will
slay
this
slay
this
said
he
not
so
long
and
wide
the
world
is
not
so
rude
and
rough
the
way
is
that
my
wrath
shall
not
attain
him
that
my
vengeance
shall
not
reach
him
then
in
swift
pursuit
departed
hiawatha
and
the
hunters
on
the
trail
of
through
the
forest
where
he
passed
it
to
the
headlands
where
he
rested
but
they
found
not
only
in
the
trampled
grasses
in
the
found
the
couch
where
he
had
rested
found
the
impress
of
his
body
from
the
lowlands
far
beneath
them
from
the
muskoday
the
meadow
turning
backward
made
a
gesture
of
defiance
made
a
gesture
of
derision
and
aloud
cried
hiawatha
from
the
summit
of
the
mountains
not
so
long
and
wide
the
world
is
not
so
rude
and
rough
the
way
is
but
my
wrath
shall
overtake
you
and
my
vengeance
shall
attain
you
over
rock
and
over
river
through
bush
and
brake
and
forest
ran
the
cunning
like
an
antelope
he
bounded
till
he
came
unto
a
streamlet
in
the
middle
of
the
forest
to
a
streamlet
still
and
tranquil
that
had
overflowed
its
margin
to
a
dam
made
by
the
beavers
to
a
pond
of
quiet
water
where
the
trees
were
standing
where
the
water
lilies
floated
where
the
rushes
waved
and
whispered
on
the
dam
stood
on
the
dam
of
trunks
and
branches
through
whose
chinks
the
water
spouted
whose
summit
flowed
the
streamlet
from
the
bottom
rose
the
beaver
looked
with
two
great
eyes
of
wonder
eyes
that
seemed
to
ask
a
question
at
the
stranger
on
the
dam
stood
his
ankles
flowed
the
streamlet
flowed
the
bright
and
silvery
water
and
he
spake
unto
the
beaver
with
a
smile
he
spake
in
this
wise
o
my
friend
ahmeek
the
beaver
cool
and
pleasant
is
the
water
let
me
dive
into
the
water
let
me
rest
there
in
your
lodges
change
me
too
into
a
beaver
cautiously
replied
the
beaver
with
reserve
he
thus
made
answer
let
me
first
consult
the
others
let
me
ask
the
other
beavers
down
he
sank
into
the
water
heavily
sank
he
as
a
stone
sinks
down
among
the
leaves
and
branches
brown
and
matted
at
the
bottom
on
the
dam
stood
his
ankles
flowed
the
streamlet
spouted
through
the
chinks
below
him
dashed
upon
the
stones
beneath
him
spread
serene
and
calm
before
him
and
the
sunshine
and
the
shadows
fell
in
flecks
and
gleams
upon
him
fell
in
little
shining
patches
through
the
waving
rustling
branches
from
the
bottom
rose
the
beavers
silently
above
the
surface
rose
one
head
and
then
another
till
the
pond
seemed
full
of
beavers
full
of
black
and
shining
faces
to
the
beavers
spake
entreating
said
in
this
wise
very
pleasant
is
your
dwelling
o
my
friends
and
safe
from
danger
can
you
not
with
all
your
cunning
all
your
wisdom
and
contrivance
change
me
too
into
a
beaver
yes
replied
ahmeek
the
beaver
he
the
king
of
all
the
beavers
let
yourself
slide
down
among
us
down
into
the
tranquil
water
down
into
the
pond
among
them
silently
sank
black
became
his
shirt
of
black
his
moccasins
and
leggings
in
a
broad
black
tail
behind
him
spread
his
and
his
fringes
he
was
changed
into
a
beaver
make
me
large
said
make
me
large
and
make
me
larger
larger
than
the
other
beavers
yes
the
beaver
chief
responded
when
our
lodge
below
you
enter
in
our
wigwam
we
will
make
you
ten
times
larger
than
the
others
thus
into
the
clear
brown
water
silently
sank
found
the
bottom
covered
over
with
the
trunks
of
trees
and
branches
hoards
of
food
against
the
winter
piles
and
heaps
against
the
famine
found
the
lodge
with
arching
doorway
leading
into
spacious
chambers
here
they
made
him
large
and
larger
made
him
largest
of
the
beavers
ten
times
larger
than
the
others
you
shall
be
our
ruler
said
they
chief
and
king
of
all
the
beavers
but
not
long
had
sat
in
state
among
the
beavers
when
there
came
a
voice
of
warning
from
the
watchman
at
his
station
in
the
and
lilies
saying
here
is
hiawatha
hiawatha
with
his
hunters
then
they
heard
a
cry
above
them
heard
a
shouting
and
a
tramping
heard
a
crashing
and
a
rushing
and
the
water
round
and
them
sank
and
sucked
away
in
eddies
and
they
knew
their
dam
was
broken
on
the
lodge
roof
the
hunters
leaped
and
broke
it
all
asunder
streamed
the
sunshine
through
the
crevice
sprang
the
beavers
through
the
doorway
hid
themselves
in
deeper
water
in
the
channel
of
the
streamlet
but
the
mighty
could
not
pass
beneath
the
doorway
he
was
puffed
with
pride
and
feeding
he
was
swollen
like
a
bladder
through
the
roof
looked
hiawatha
cried
aloud
o
vain
are
all
your
craft
and
cunning
vain
your
manifold
disguises
well
i
know
you
with
their
clubs
they
beat
and
bruised
him
beat
to
death
poor
pounded
him
as
maize
is
pounded
till
his
skull
was
crushed
to
pieces
six
tall
hunters
lithe
and
limber
bore
him
home
on
poles
and
branches
bore
the
body
of
the
beaver
but
the
ghost
the
jeebi
in
him
thought
and
felt
as
still
lived
on
as
and
it
fluttered
strove
and
struggled
waving
hither
waving
thither
as
the
curtains
of
a
wigwam
struggle
with
their
thongs
of
when
the
wintry
wind
is
blowing
till
it
drew
itself
together
till
it
rose
up
from
the
body
till
it
took
the
form
and
features
of
the
cunning
vanishing
into
the
forest
but
the
wary
hiawatha
saw
the
figure
ere
it
vanished
saw
the
form
of
glide
into
the
soft
blue
shadow
of
the
of
the
forest
toward
the
squares
of
white
beyond
it
toward
an
opening
in
the
forest
like
a
wind
it
rushed
and
panted
bending
all
the
boughs
before
it
and
behind
it
as
the
rain
comes
came
the
steps
of
hiawatha
to
a
lake
with
many
islands
came
the
breathless
where
among
the
pishnekuh
the
brant
were
sailing
through
the
tufts
of
rushes
floating
steering
through
the
reedy
islands
now
their
broad
black
beaks
they
lifted
now
they
plunged
beneath
the
water
now
they
darkened
in
the
shadow
now
they
brightened
in
the
sunshine
pishnekuh
cried
pishnekuh
my
brothers
said
he
change
me
to
a
brant
with
plumage
with
a
shining
neck
and
feathers
make
me
large
and
make
me
larger
ten
times
larger
than
the
others
straightway
to
a
brant
they
changed
him
with
two
huge
and
dusky
pinions
with
a
bosom
smooth
and
rounded
with
a
bill
like
two
great
paddles
made
him
larger
than
the
others
ten
times
larger
than
the
largest
just
as
shouting
from
the
forest
on
the
shore
stood
hiawatha
up
they
rose
with
cry
and
clamor
with
a
whir
and
beat
of
pinions
rose
up
from
the
reedy
islands
from
the
and
lilies
and
they
said
to
in
your
flying
look
not
downward
take
good
heed
and
look
not
downward
lest
some
strange
mischance
should
happen
lest
some
great
mishap
befall
you
fast
and
far
they
fled
to
northward
fast
and
far
through
mist
and
sunshine
fed
among
the
moors
and
slept
among
the
reeds
and
rushes
on
the
morrow
as
they
journeyed
buoyed
and
lifted
by
the
wafted
onward
by
the
blowing
fresh
and
strong
behind
them
rose
a
sound
of
human
voices
rose
a
clamor
from
beneath
them
from
the
lodges
of
a
village
from
the
people
miles
beneath
them
for
the
people
of
the
village
saw
the
flock
of
brant
with
wonder
saw
the
wings
of
flapping
far
up
in
the
ether
broader
than
two
doorway
curtains
heard
the
shouting
knew
the
voice
of
hiawatha
knew
the
outcry
of
iagoo
and
forgetful
of
the
warning
drew
his
neck
in
and
looked
downward
and
the
wind
that
blew
behind
him
caught
his
mighty
fan
of
feathers
sent
him
wheeling
whirling
downward
all
in
vain
did
struggle
to
regain
his
balance
whirling
round
and
round
and
downward
he
beheld
in
turn
the
village
and
in
turn
the
flock
above
him
saw
the
village
coming
nearer
and
the
flock
receding
farther
heard
the
voices
growing
louder
heard
the
shouting
and
the
laughter
saw
no
more
the
flocks
above
him
only
saw
the
earth
beneath
him
dead
out
of
the
empty
heaven
dead
among
the
shouting
people
with
a
heavy
sound
and
sullen
fell
the
brant
with
broken
pinions
but
his
soul
his
ghost
his
shadow
still
survived
as
took
again
the
form
and
features
of
the
handsome
yenadizze
and
again
went
rushing
onward
followed
fast
by
hiawatha
crying
not
so
wide
the
world
is
not
so
long
and
rough
the
way
is
but
my
wrath
shall
overtake
you
but
my
vengeance
shall
attain
you
and
so
near
he
came
so
near
him
that
his
hand
was
stretched
to
seize
him
his
right
hand
to
seize
and
hold
him
when
the
cunning
whirled
and
spun
about
in
circles
fanned
the
air
into
a
whirlwind
danced
the
dust
and
leaves
about
him
and
amid
the
whirling
eddies
sprang
into
a
hollow
changed
himself
into
a
serpent
gliding
out
through
root
and
rubbish
with
his
right
hand
hiawatha
smote
amain
the
hollow
rent
it
into
shreds
and
splinters
left
it
lying
there
in
fragments
but
in
vain
for
once
again
in
human
figure
full
in
sight
ran
on
before
him
sped
away
in
gust
and
whirlwind
on
the
shores
of
gitche
gumee
westward
by
the
came
unto
the
rocky
headlands
to
the
pictured
rocks
of
sandstone
looking
over
lake
and
landscape
and
the
old
man
of
the
mountain
he
the
manito
of
mountains
opened
wide
his
rocky
doorways
opened
wide
his
deep
abysses
giving
shelter
in
his
caverns
dark
and
dreary
bidding
welcome
to
his
gloomy
lodge
of
sandstone
there
without
stood
hiawatha
found
the
doorways
closed
against
him
with
his
mittens
minjekahwun
smote
great
caverns
in
the
sandstone
cried
aloud
in
tones
of
thunder
open
i
am
hiawatha
but
the
old
man
of
the
mountain
opened
not
and
made
no
answer
from
the
silent
crags
of
sandstone
from
the
gloomy
rock
abysses
then
he
raised
his
hands
to
heaven
called
imploring
on
the
tempest
called
waywassimo
the
lightning
and
the
thunder
annemeekee
and
they
came
with
night
and
darkness
sweeping
down
the
from
the
distant
thunder
mountains
and
the
trembling
heard
the
footsteps
of
the
thunder
saw
the
red
eyes
of
the
lightning
was
afraid
and
crouched
and
trembled
then
waywassimo
the
lightning
smote
the
doorways
of
the
caverns
with
his
smote
the
doorways
smote
the
jutting
crags
of
sandstone
and
the
thunder
annemeekee
shouted
down
into
the
caverns
saying
where
is
and
the
crags
fell
and
beneath
them
dead
among
the
rocky
ruins
lay
the
cunning
lay
the
handsome
yenadizze
slain
in
his
own
human
figure
ended
were
his
wild
adventures
ended
were
his
tricks
and
gambols
ended
all
his
craft
and
cunning
ended
all
his
all
his
gambling
and
his
dancing
all
his
wooing
of
the
maidens
then
the
noble
hiawatha
took
his
soul
his
ghost
his
shadow
spake
and
said
o
never
more
in
human
figure
shall
you
search
for
new
adventures
never
more
with
jest
and
laughter
dance
the
dust
and

in
whirlwinds
but
above
there
in
the
heavens
you
shall
soar
and
sail
in
circles
i
will
change
you
to
an
eagle
to
keneu
the
great
chief
of
all
the
fowls
with

chief
of
hiawatha
chickens
and
the
name
of
lingers
still
among
the
people
lingers
still
among
the
singers
and
among
the
and
in
winter
when
the
whirl
in
eddies
round
the
lodges
when
the
wind
in
gusty
tumult
the
pipes
and
whistles
there
they
cry
comes
he
is
dancing
through
the
village
he
is
gathering
in
his
harvest
xviii
the
death
of
kwasind
far
and
wide
among
the
nations
spread
the
name
and
fame
of
kwasind
no
man
dared
to
strive
with
kwasind
no
man
could
compete
with
kwasind
but
the
mischievous
they
the
envious
little
people
they
the
fairies
and
the
pygmies
plotted
and
conspired
against
him
if
this
hateful
kwasind
said
they
if
this
great
outrageous
fellow
goes
on
thus
a
little
longer
tearing
everything
he
touches
rending
everything
to
pieces
filling
all
the
world
with
wonder
what
becomes
of
the
who
will
care
for
the
he
will
tread
us
down
like
mushrooms
drive
us
all
into
the
water
give
our
bodies
to
be
eaten
by
the
wicked
by
the
spirits
of
the
water
so
the
angry
little
people
all
conspired
against
the
strong
man
all
conspired
to
murder
kwasind
yes
to
rid
the
world
of
kwasind
the
audacious
overbearing
heartless
haughty
dangerous
kwasind
now
this
wondrous
strength
of
kwasind
in
his
crown
alone
was
seated
in
his
crown
too
was
his
weakness
there
alone
could
he
be
wounded
nowhere
else
could
weapon
pierce
him
nowhere
else
could
weapon
harm
him
even
there
the
only
weapon
that
could
wound
him
that
could
slay
him
was
the
of
the
was
the
blue
cone
of
the
this
was
kwasind
fatal
secret
known
to
no
man
among
mortals
but
the
cunning
little
people
the
knew
the
secret
knew
the
only
way
to
kill
him
so
they
gathered
cones
together
gathered
of
the
gathered
blue
cones
of
the
in
the
woods
by
taquamenaw
brought
them
to
the
river
margin
heaped
them
in
great
piles
together
where
the
red
rocks
from
the
margin
jutting
overhang
the
river
there
they
lay
in
wait
for
kwasind
the
malicious
little
people
was
an
afternoon
in
summer
very
hot
and
still
the
air
was
very
smooth
the
gliding
river
motionless
the
sleeping
shadows
insects
glistened
in
the
sunshine
insects
skated
on
the
water
filled
the
drowsy
air
with
buzzing
with
a
far
resounding
down
the
river
came
the
strong
man
in
his
birch
canoe
came
kwasind
floating
slowly
down
the
current
of
the
sluggish
taquamenaw
very
languid
with
the
weather
very
sleepy
with
the
silence
from
the
overhanging
branches
from
the
tassels
of
the
soft
the
spirit
of
sleep
descended
by
his
airy
hosts
surrounded
his
invisible
attendants
came
the
spirit
of
sleep
nepahwin
like
a
burnished
like
a
he
hovered
the
drowsy
head
of
kwasind
to
his
ear
there
came
a
murmur
as
of
waves
upon
a
as
of
tumbling
waters
as
of
winds
among
the
and
he
felt
upon
his
forehead
blows
of
little
airy
wielded
by
the
slumbrous
legions
of
the
spirit
of
sleep
nepahwin
as
of
some
one
breathing
on
him
at
the
first
blow
of
their
fell
a
drowsiness
on
kwasind
at
the
second
blow
they
smote
him
motionless
his
paddle
rested
at
the
third
before
his
vision
reeled
the
landscape
into
darkness
very
sound
asleep
was
kwasind
so
he
floated
down
the
river
like
a
blind
man
seated
upright
floated
down
the
taquamenaw
underneath
the
trembling
underneath
the
wooded
headlands
underneath
the
war
encampment
of
the
pygmies
the
there
they
stood
all
armed
and
waiting
hurled
the
down
upon
him
struck
him
on
his
brawny
shoulders
on
his
crown
defenceless
struck
him
death
to
kwasind
was
the
sudden
of
the
little
people
and
he
sideways
swayed
and
tumbled
sideways
fell
into
the
river
plunged
beneath
the
sluggish
water
headlong
as
an
otter
plunges
and
the
birch
canoe
abandoned
drifted
empty
down
the
river
bottom
upward
swerved
and
drifted
nothing
more
was
seen
of
kwasind
but
the
memory
of
the
strong
man
lingered
long
among
the
people
and
whenever
through
the
forest
raged
and
roared
the
wintry
tempest
and
the
branches
tossed
and
troubled
creaked
and
groaned
and
split
asunder
kwasind
cried
they
that
is
kwasind
he
is
gathering
in
his
xix
the
ghosts
never
stoops
the
soaring
vulture
on
his
quarry
in
the
desert
on
the
sick
or
wounded
bison
but
another
vulture
watching
from
his
high
aerial
sees
the
downward
plunge
and
follows
and
a
third
pursues
the
second
coming
from
the
invisible
ether
first
a
speck
and
then
a
vulture
till
the
air
is
dark
with
pinions
so
disasters
come
not
singly
but
as
if
they
watched
and
waited
scanning
one
another
motions
when
the
first
descends
the
others
follow
follow
gathering
round
their
victim
sick
and
wounded
first
a
shadow
then
a
sorrow
till
the
air
is
dark
with
anguish
now
all
the
dreary
mighty
peboan
the
winter
breathing
on
the
lakes
and
rivers
into
stone
had
changed
their
waters
from
his
hair
he
shook
the
till
the
plains
were
strewn
with
whiteness
one
uninterrupted
level
as
if
stooping
the
creator
with
his
hand
had
smoothed
them
over
through
the
forest
wide
and
wailing
roamed
the
hunter
on
his
in
the
village
worked
the
women
pounded
maize
or
dressed
the
and
the
young
men
played
together
on
the
ice
the
noisy
on
the
plain
the
dance
of
one
dark
evening
after
sundown
in
her
wigwam
laughing
water
sat
with
old
nokomis
waiting
for
the
steps
of
hiawatha
homeward
from
the
hunt
returning
on
their
faces
gleamed
the
firelight
painting
them
with
streaks
of
crimson
in
the
eyes
of
old
nokomis
glimmered
like
the
watery
moonlight
in
the
eyes
of
laughing
water
glistened
like
the
sun
in
water
and
behind
them
crouched
their
shadows
in
the
corners
of
the
wigwam
and
the
smoke
in
wreaths
above
them
climbed
and
crowded
through
the
then
the
curtain
of
the
doorway
from
without
was
slowly
lifted
brighter
glowed
the
fire
a
moment
and
a
moment
swerved
the
as
two
women
entered
softly
passed
the
doorway
uninvited
without
word
of
salutation
without
sign
of
recognition
sat
down
in
the
farthest
corner
crouching
low
among
the
shadows
from
their
aspect
and
their
garments
strangers
seemed
they
in
the
village
very
pale
and
haggard
were
they
as
they
sat
there
sad
and
silent
trembling
cowering
with
the
shadows
was
it
the
wind
above
the
muttering
down
into
the
wigwam
was
it
the
owl
the
hooting
from
the
dismal
forest
sure
a
voice
said
in
the
silence
these
are
corpses
clad
in
garments
these
are
ghosts
that
come
to
haunt
you
from
the
kingdom
of
ponemah
from
the
land
of
the
hereafter
homeward
now
came
hiawatha
from
his
hunting
in
the
forest
with
the
snow
upon
his
tresses
and
the
red
deer
on
his
shoulders
at
the
feet
of
laughing
water
down
he
threw
his
lifeless
burden
nobler
handsomer
she
thought
him
than
when
first
he
came
to
woo
her
first
threw
down
the
deer
before
her
as
a
token
of
his
wishes
as
a
promise
of
the
future
then
he
turned
and
saw
the
strangers
cowering
crouching
with
the
shadows
said
within
himself
who
are
they
what
strange
guests
has
minnehaha
but
he
questioned
not
the
strangers
only
spake
to
bid
them
welcome
to
his
lodge
his
food
his
fireside
when
the
evening
meal
was
ready
and
the
deer
had
been
divided
both
the
pallid
guests
the
strangers
springing
from
among
the
shadows
seized
upon
the
choicest
portions
seized
the
white
fat
of
the
roebuck
set
apart
for
laughing
water
for
the
wife
of
hiawatha
without
asking
without
thanking
eagerly
devoured
the
morsels
flitted
back
among
the
shadows
in
the
corner
of
the
wigwam
not

not

made
nokomis
not

their

softly
whispered
saying
they
are
famished
let
them
do
what
best
delights
them
let
them
eat
for
they
are
famished
many
a
daylight
dawned
and
darkened
many
a
night
shook
off
the
daylight
as
the
pine
shakes
off
the
from
the
midnight
of
its
branches
day
by
day
the
guests
unmoving
sat
there
silent
in
the
wigwam
but
by
night
in
storm
or
starlight
forth
they
went
into
the
forest
bringing
to
the
wigwam
bringing
for
the
burning
always
sad
and
always
silent
and
whenever
hiawatha
came
from
fishing
or
from
hunting
when
the
evening
meal
was
ready
and
the
food
had
been
divided
gliding
from
their
darksome
corner
came
the
pallid
guests
the
strangers
seized
upon
the
choicest
portions
set
aside
for
laughing
water
and
without
rebuke
or
question
flitted
back
among
the
shadows
never
once
had
hiawatha
by
a
word
or
look
reproved
them
never
once
had
old
nokomis
made
a
gesture
of
impatience
never
once
had
laughing
water
shown
resentment
at
the
outrage
all
had
they
endured
in
silence
that
the
rights
of
guest
and
stranger
that
the
virtue
of
by
a
look
might
not
be
lessened
by
a
word
might
not
be
broken
once
at
midnight
hiawatha
ever
wakeful
ever
watchful
in
the
wigwam
dimly
lighted
by
the
brands
that
still
were
burning
by
the
glimmering
flickering
firelight
heard
a
sighing
oft
repeated
from
his
couch
rose
hiawatha
from
his
shaggy
hides
of
bison
pushed
aside
the
curtain
saw
the
pallid
guests
the
shadows
sitting
upright
on
their
couches
weeping
in
the
silent
midnight
and
he
said
o
guests
why
is
it
that
your
hearts
are
so
afflicted
that
you
sob
so
in
the
midnight
has
perchance
the
old
nokomis
has
my
wife
my
minnehaha
wronged
or
grieved
you
by
unkindness
failed
in
hospitable
duties
then
the
shadows
ceased
from
weeping
ceased
from
sobbing
and
lamenting
and
they
said
with
gentle
voices
we
are
ghosts
of
the
departed
souls
of
those
who
once
were
with
you
from
the
realms
of
chibiabos
hither
have
we
come
to
try
you
hither
have
we
come
to
warn
you
cries
of
grief
and
lamentation
reach
us
in
the
blessed
islands
cries
of
anguish
from
the
living
calling
back
their
friends
departed
sadden
us
with
useless
sorrow
therefore
have
we
come
to
try
you
no
one
knows
us
no
one
heeds
us
we
are
but
a
burden
to
you
and
we
see
that
the
departed
have
no
place
among
the
living
think
of
this
o
hiawatha
speak
of
it
to
all
the
people
that
henceforward
and
forever
they
no
more
with
lamentations
sadden
the
souls
of
the
departed
in
the
islands
of
the
blessed
do
not
lay
such
heavy
burdens
in
the
graves
of
those
you
bury
not
such
weight
of
furs
and
wampum
not
such
weight
of
pots
and
kettles
for
the
spirits
faint
beneath
them
only
give
them
food
to
carry
only
give
them
fire
to
light
them
four
days
is
the
spirit
journey
to
the
land
of
ghosts
and
shadows
four
its
lonely
night
encampments
four
times
must
their
fires
be
lighted
therefore
when
the
dead
are
buried
let
a
fire
as
night
approaches
four
times
on
the
grave
be
kindled
that
the
soul
upon
its
journey
may
not
lack
the
cheerful
firelight
may
not
grope
about
in
darkness
farewell
noble
hiawatha
we
have
put
you
to
the
trial
to
the
proof
have
put
your
patience
by
the
insult
of
our
presence
by
the
outrage
of
our
actions
we
have
found
you
great
and
noble
fail
not
in
the
greater
trial
faint
not
in
the
harder
struggle
when
they
ceased
a
sudden
darkness
fell
and
filled
the
silent
wigwam
hiawatha
heard
a
rustle
as
of
garments
trailing
by
him
heard
the
curtain
of
the
doorway
lifted
by
a
hand
he
saw
not
felt
the
cold
breath
of
the
night
air
for
a
moment
saw
the
starlight
but
he
saw
the
ghosts
no
longer
saw
no
more
the
wandering
spirits
from
the
kingdom
of
ponemah
from
the
land
of
the
hereafter
xx
the
famine
oh
the
long
and
dreary
winter
oh
the
cold
and
cruel
winter
ever
thicker
thicker
thicker
froze
the
ice
on
lake
and
river
ever
deeper
deeper
deeper
fell
the
snow
all
the
landscape
fell
the
covering
snow
and
drifted
through
the
forest
round
the
village
hardly
from
his
buried
wigwam
could
the
hunter
force
a
passage
with
his
mittens
and
his
vainly
walked
he
through
the
forest
sought
for
bird
or
beast
and
found
none
saw
no
track
of
deer
or
rabbit
in
the
snow
beheld
no
footprints
in
the
ghastly
gleaming
forest
fell
and
could
not
rise
from
weakness
perished
there
from
cold
and
hunger
oh
the
famine
and
the
fever
oh
the
wasting
of
the
famine
oh
the
blasting
of

children
oh
the
anguish
of
the
women
all
the
earth

sick
and
famished
hungry
was
the
air
around
them
hungry
was
the
sky
above
them
and
the
hungry
stars
in
heaven
like
the
eyes
of
wolves
glared
at
them
into
hiawatha
wigwam
came
two
other
guests
as
silent
as
the
ghosts
were
and
as
gloomy
waited
not
to
be
invited
did
not
parley
at
the
doorway
sat
there
without
word
of
welcome
in
the
seat
of
laughing
water
looked
with
haggard
eyes
and
hollow
at
the
face
of
laughing
water
and
the
foremost
said
behold
me
i
am
famine
bukadawin
and
the
other
said
behold
me
i
am
fever
ahkosewin
and
the
lovely
minnehaha
shuddered
as
they
looked
upon
her
shuddered
at
the
words
they
uttered
lay
down
on
her
bed
in
silence
hid
her
face
but
made
no
answer
lay
there
trembling
freezing
burning
at
the
looks
they
cast
upon
her
at
the
fearful
words
they
uttered
forth
into
the
empty
forest
rushed
the
maddened
hiawatha
in
his
heart
was
deadly
sorrow
in
his
face
a
stony
firmness
on
his
brow
the
sweat
of
anguish
started
but
it
froze
and
fell
not
wrapped
in
furs
and
armed
for
hunting
with
his
mighty
bow
of
with
his
quiver
full
of
arrows
with
his
mittens
minjekahwun
into
the
vast
and
vacant
forest
on
his

forward
gitche

face
uplifted

bitter
hour
of
anguish

must
perish

for
my
dying
minnehaha
through
the
forest
through
the
forest
vast
and
vacant
rang
that
cry
of
desolation
but
there
came
no
other
answer
than
the
echo
of
his
crying
than
the
echo
of
the
woodlands
minnehaha
minnehaha
all
day
long
roved
hiawatha
in
that
melancholy
forest
through
the
shadow
of
whose
thickets
in
the
pleasant
days
of
summer
of
that
forgotten
summer
he
had
brought
his
young
wife
homeward
from
the
land
of
the
dacotahs
when
the
birds
sang
in
the
thickets
and
the
streamlets
laughed
and
glistened
and
the
air
was
full
of
fragrance
and
the
lovely
laughing
water
said
with
voice
that
did
not
tremble
i
will
follow
you
my
husband
in
the
wigwam
with
nokomis
with
those
gloomy
guests
that
watched
her
with
the
famine
and
the
fever
she
was
lying
the
beloved

the
dying
minnehaha
hark

the
land
of
the
dacotahs

child
said
old
nokomis

the
smoke
that

and
beckons

said
she
the
eyes
of
pauguk
glare
upon
me
in
the
darkness
i
can
feel
his
icy
fingers
clasping
mine
amid
the
darkness
hiawatha
hiawatha
and
the
desolate
hiawatha
far
away
amid
the
forest
miles
away
among
the
mountains
heard
that
sudden
cry
of
anguish
heard
the
voice
of
minnehaha
calling
to
him
in
the
darkness
hiawatha
hiawatha
over
waste
and
pathless
under
branches
homeward
hurried
hiawatha
heard
nokomis
moaning
wailing
wahonowin
wahonowin
would
that
i
had
perished
for
you
would
that
i
were
dead
as
you
are
wahonowin
wahonowin
and
he
rushed
into
the
wigwam
saw
the
old
nokomis
slowly
rocking
to
and
fro
and
moaning
saw
his
lovely
minnehaha
lying
dead
and
cold
before
him
and
his
bursting
heart
within
him
uttered
such
a
cry
of
anguish
that
the
forest
moaned
and
shuddered
that
the
very
stars
in
heaven
shook
and
trembled
with
his
anguish
then
he
sat
down
still
and
speechless
on
the
bed
of
minnehaha
at
the
feet
of
laughing
water
at
those
willing
feet
that
never
more
would
lightly
run
to
meet
him
never
more
would
lightly
follow
with
both
hands
his
face
he
covered
seven
long
days
and
nights
he
sat
there
as
if
in
a
swoon
he
sat
there
speechless
motionless
unconscious
of
the
daylight
or
the
darkness
then
they
buried
minnehaha
in
the
snow
a
grave
they
made
her
in
the
forest
deep
and
darksome
underneath
the
moaning
hemlocks
clothed
her
in
her
richest
garments
wrapped
her
in
her
robes
of
ermine
covered
her
with
snow
like
ermine
thus
they
buried
minnehaha
and
at
night
a
fire
was
lighted
on
her
grave
four
times
was
kindled
for
her
soul
upon
its
journey
to
the
islands
of
the
blessed
from
his
doorway
hiawatha
saw
it
burning
in
the
forest
lighting
up
the
gloomy
hemlocks
from
his
sleepless
bed
uprising
from
the
bed
of
minnehaha
stood
and
watched
it
at
the
doorway
that
it
might
not
be
extinguished
might
not
leave
her
in
the
darkness
farewell
said
he
minnehaha

the
white
man
foot
in
his
lodge
beside
a
river
close
beside
a
frozen
river
sat
an
old
man
sad
and
lonely
white
his
hair
was
as
a
dull
and
low
his
fire
was
burning
and
the
old
man
shook
and
trembled
folded
in
his
waubewyon
in
his
tattered
hearing
nothing
but
the
tempest
as
it
roared
along
the
forest
seeing
nothing
but
the
as
it
whirled
and
hissed
and
drifted
all
the
coals
were
white
with
ashes
and
the
fire
was
slowly
dying
as
a
young
man
walking
lightly
at
the
open
doorway
entered
red
with
blood
of
youth
his
cheeks
were
soft
his
eyes
as
stars
in
bound
his
forehead
was
with
grasses
bound
and
plumed
with
scented
grasses
on
his
lips
a
smile
of
beauty
filling
all
the
lodge
with
sunshine
in
his
hand
a
bunch
of
blossoms
filling
all
the
lodge
with
sweetness
ah
my
son
exclaimed
the
old
man
happy
are
my
eyes
to
see
you
sit
here
on
the
mat
beside
me
sit
here
by
the
dying
embers
let
us
pass
the
night
together
tell
me
of
your
strange
adventures
of
the
lands
where
you
have
travelled
i
will
tell
you
of
my
prowess
of
my
many
deeds
of
wonder
from
his
pouch
he
drew
his
very
old
and
strangely
fashioned
made
of
red
stone
was
the
and
the
stem
a
reed
with
feathers
filled
the
pipe
with
bark
of
willow
placed
a
burning
coal
upon
it
gave
it
to
his
guest
the
stranger
and
began
to
speak
in
this
wise
when
i
blow
my
breath
about
me
when
i
breathe
upon
the
landscape
motionless
are
all
the
rivers
hard
as
stone
becomes
the
water
and
the
young
man
answered
smiling
when
i
blow
my
breath
about
me
when
i
breathe
upon
the
landscape
flowers
spring
up
all
the
meadows
singing
onward
rush
the
rivers
when
i
shake
my
hoary
tresses
said
the
old
man
darkly
frowning
all
the
land
with
snow
is
covered
all
the
leaves
from
all
the
branches
fall
and
fade
and
die
and
wither
for
i
breathe
and
lo
they
are
not
from
the
waters
and
the
marshes
rise
the
wild
goose
and
the
heron
fly
away
to
distant
regions
for
i
speak
and
lo
they
are
not
and
my
footsteps
wander
all
the
wild
beasts
of
the
forest
hide
themselves
in
holes
and
caverns
and
the
earth
becomes
as
flintstone
when
i
shake
my
flowing
ringlets
said
the
young
man
softly
laughing
showers
of
rain
fall
warm
and
welcome
plants
lift
up
their
heads
rejoicing
back
unto
their
lakes
and
marshes
come
the
wild
goose
and
the
heron
homeward
shoots
the
arrowy
swallow
sing
the
bluebird
and
the
robin
and
my
footsteps
wander
all
the
meadows
wave
with
blossoms
all
the
woodlands
ring
with
music
all
the
trees
are
dark
with
foliage
while
they
spake
the
night
departed
from
the
distant
realms
of
wabun
from
his
shining
lodge
of
silver
like
a
warrior
robed
and
painted
came
the
sun
and
said
behold
me
gheezis
the
great
sun
behold
me
then
the
old
man
tongue
was
speechless
and
the
air
grew
warm
and
pleasant
and
upon
the
wigwam
sweetly
sang
the
bluebird
and
the
robin
and
the
stream
began
to
murmur
and
a
scent
of
growing
grasses
through
the
lodge
was
gently
wafted
and
segwun
the
youthful
stranger
more
distinctly
in
the
daylight
saw
the
icy
face
before
him
it
was
peboan
the
winter
from
his
eyes
the
tears
were
flowing
as
from
melting
lakes
the
streamlets
and
his
body
shrunk
and
dwindled
as
the
shouting
sun
ascended
till
into
the
air
it
faded
till
into
the
ground
it
vanished
and
the
young
man
saw
before
him
on
the
of
the
wigwam
where
the
fire
had
smoked
and
smouldered
saw
the
earliest
flower
of
saw
the
beauty
of
the
saw
the
miskodeed
in
blossom
thus
it
was
that
in
the
after
that
coldness
that
intolerable
winter
came
the
spring
with
all
its
splendor
all
its
birds
and
all
its
blossoms
all
its
flowers
and
leaves
and
grasses
sailing
on
the
wind
to
northward
flying
in
great
flocks
like
arrows
like
huge
arrows
shot
through
heaven
passed
the
swan
the
mahnahbezee
speaking
almost
as
a
man
speaks
and
in
long
lines
waving
bending
like
a
snapped
asunder
came
the
white
goose
and
in
pairs
or
singly
flying
mahng
the
loon
with
clangorous
pinions
the
blue
heron
the
and
the
grouse
the
mushkodasa
in
the
thickets
and
the
meadows
piped
the
bluebird
the
owaissa
on
the
summit
of
the
lodges
sang
the
robin
the
opechee
in
the
covert
of
the
cooed
the
pigeon
the
omemee
and
the
sorrowing
hiawatha
speechless
in
his
infinite
sorrow
heard
their
voices
calling
to
him
went
forth
from
his
gloomy
doorway
stood
and
gazed
into
the
heaven
gazed
upon
the
earth
and
waters
from
his
wanderings
far
to
eastward
from
the
regions
of
the
morning
from
the
shining
land
of
wabun
homeward
now
returned
iagoo
the
great
traveller
the
great
boaster
full
of
new
and
strange
adventures
marvels

and
many
wonders
and
the
people
of
the
village
listened
to
him
as
he
told
them
of
his
marvellous
adventures
laughing
answered
him
in
this
wise
ugh
it
is
indeed
iagoo

such
wonders
he
had
seen

said

said
this
to

in

vision
i
beheld
too
in
that
vision
all
the
secrets
of
the
future
of
the
distant
days
that
shall
be
i
beheld
the
westward
marches
of
the
unknown
crowded
nations
all
the
land
was
full
of
people
restless
struggling
toiling
striving
speaking
many
tongues
yet
feeling
but
one
in
their
bosoms
in
the
woodlands
rang
their
axes
smoked
their
towns
in
all
the
valleys
over
all
the
lakes
and
rivers
rushed
their
great
canoes
of
thunder
then
a
darker
drearier
vision
passed
before
me
vague
and
i
beheld
our
nation
scattered
all
forgetful
of
my
counsels
weakened
warring
with
each
other
saw
the
remnants
of
our
people
sweeping
westward
wild
and
woful
like

departure
by

of

gumee
by
the
shining
at
the
doorway
of
his
wigwam
in
the
pleasant
summer
morning
hiawatha
stood
and
waited
all
the
air
was
full
of
freshness
all
the
earth
was
bright
and
joyous
and
before
him
through
the
sunshine
westward
toward
the
neighboring
forest
passed
in
golden
swarms
the
ahmo
passed
the
bees
the
burning
singing
in
the
sunshine
bright
above
him
shone
the
heavens
level
spread
the
lake
before
him
from
its
bosom
leaped
the
sturgeon
sparkling
flashing
in
the
sunshine
on
its
margin
the
great
forest
stood
reflected
in
the
water
every
had
its
shadow
motionless
beneath
the
water
from
the
brow
of
hiawatha
gone
was
every
trace
of
sorrow
as
the
fog
from
off
the
water
as
the
mist
from
off
the
meadow
with
a
smile
of
joy
and
triumph
with
a
look
of
exultation
as
of
one
who
in
a
vision
sees
what
is
to
be
but
is
not
stood
and
waited
hiawatha
toward
the
sun
his
hands
were
lifted
both
the
palms
spread
out
against
it
and
between
the
parted
fingers
fell
the
sunshine
on
his
features
flecked
with
light
his
naked
shoulders
as
it
falls
and
flecks
an
through
the
rifted
leaves
and
branches
the
water
floating
flying
something
in
the
hazy
distance
something
in
the
mists
of
morning
loomed
and
lifted
from
the
water
now
seemed
floating
now
seemed
flying
coming
nearer
nearer
nearer
was
it
shingebis
the
diver
or
the
pelican
the
shada
or
the
heron
the
or
the
white
goose
with
the
water
dripping
flashing
from
its
glossy
neck
and
feathers
it
was
neither
goose
nor
diver
neither
pelican
nor
heron
the
water
floating
flying
through
the
shining
mist
of
morning
but
a
birch
canoe
with
paddles
rising
sinking
on
the
water
dripping
flashing
in
the
sunshine
and
within
it
came
a
people
from
the
distant
land
of
wabun
from
the
farthest
realms
of
morning
came
the
chief
the
prophet
he
the
priest
of
prayer
the
with
his
guides
and
his
companions
and
the
noble
hiawatha
with
his
hands
aloft
extended
held
aloft
in
sign
of
welcome
waited
full
of
exultation
till
the
birch
canoe
with
paddles
grated
on
the
shining
pebbles
stranded
on
the
sandy
margin
till
the
chief
the
with
the
cross
upon
his
bosom
landed
on
the
sandy
margin
then
the
joyous
hiawatha
cried
aloud
and
spake
in
this
wise
beautiful
is
the
sun
o
strangers
when
you
come
so
far
to
see
us
all
our
town
in
peace
awaits
you
all
our
doors
stand
open
for
you
you
shall
enter
all
our
wigwams
for
the
heart
right
hand
we
give
you
never
bloomed
the
earth
so
gayly
never
shone
the
sun
so
brightly
as
they
shine
and
blossom
when
you
come
so
far
to
see
us
never
was
our
lake
so
tranquil
nor
so
free
from
rocks
and
for
your
birch
canoe
in
passing
has
removed
both
rock
and
never
before
had
our
tobacco
such
a
sweet
and
pleasant
flavor
never
the
broad
leaves
of
our
cornfields
were
so
beautiful
to
look
on
as
they
seem
to
us
this
morning
when
you
come
so
far
to
see
us
and
the
chief
made
answer
stammered
in
his
speech
a
little
speaking
words
yet
unfamiliar
peace
be
with
you
hiawatha
peace
be
with
you
and
your
people
peace
of
prayer
and
peace
of
pardon
peace
of
christ
and
joy
of
mary
then
the
generous
hiawatha
led
the
strangers
to
his
wigwam
seated
them
on
skins
of
bison
seated
them
on
skins
of
ermine
and
the
careful
old
nokomis
brought
them
food
in
bowls
of
basswood
water
brought
in
birchen
dippers
and
the
calumet
the
filled
and
lighted
for
their
smoking
all
the
old
men
of
the
village
all
the
warriors
of
the
nation
all
the
jossakeeds
the
prophets
the
magicians
the
wabenos
and
the
the
medas
came
to
bid
the
strangers
welcome
it
is
well
they
said
o
brothers
that
you
come
so
far
to
see
us
in
a
circle
round
the
doorway
with
their
pipes
they
sat
in
silence
waiting
to
behold
the
strangers
waiting
to
receive
their
message
till
the
chief
the
from
the
wigwam
came
to
greet
them
stammering
in
his
speech
a
little
speaking
words
yet
unfamiliar
it
is
well
they
said
o
brother
that
you
come
so
far
to
see
us
then
the
chief
the
prophet
told
his
message
to
the
people
told
the
purport
of
his
mission
told
them
of
the
virgin
mary
and
her
blessed
son
the
saviour
how
in
distant
lands
and
ages
he
had
lived
on
earth
as
we
do
how
he
fasted
prayed
and
labored
how
the
jews
the
tribe
accursed
mocked
him
scourged
him
crucified
him
how
he
rose
from
where
they
laid
him
walked
again
with
his
disciples
and
ascended
into
heaven
and
the
chiefs
made
answer
saying
we
have
listened
to
your
message
we
have
heard
your
words
of
wisdom
we
will
think
on
what
you
tell
us
it
is
well
for
us
o
brothers
that
you
come
so
far
to
see
us
then
they
rose
up
and
departed
each
one
homeward
to
his
wigwam
to
the
young
men
and
the
women
told
the
story
of
the
strangers
whom
the
master
of
life
had
sent
them
from
the
shining
land
of
wabun
heavy
with
the
heat
and
silence
grew
the
afternoon
of
summer
with
a
drowsy
sound
the
forest
whispered
round
the
sultry
wigwam
with
a
sound
of
sleep
the
water
rippled
on
the
beach
below
it
from
the
cornfields
shrill
and
ceaseless
sang
the
grasshopper
and
the
guests
of
hiawatha
weary
with
the
heat
of
summer
slumbered
in
the
sultry
wigwam
slowly
the
simmering
landscape
fell
the
evening
dusk
and
coolness
and
the
long
and
level
sunbeams
shot
their
spears
into
the
forest
breaking
through
its
shields
of
shadow
rushed
into
each
secret
ambush
searched
each
thicket
dingle
hollow
still
the
guests
of
hiawatha
slumbered
in
the
silent
wigwam
from
his
place
rose
hiawatha

to

on

shore
stood
hiawatha
turned
and
waved
his
hand
at
parting
on
the
clear
and
luminous
water
launched
his
birch
canoe
for
sailing
from
the
pebbles
of
the
margin
shoved
it
forth
into
the
water
whispered
to
it
westward
westward
and
with
speed
it
darted
forward
and
the
evening
sun
descending
set
the
clouds
on
fire
with
redness
burned
the
broad
sky
like
a
prairie
left
upon
the
level
water
one
long
track
and
trail
of
splendor
down
whose
stream
as
down

river
westward
westward
hiawatha
sailed
into
the
fiery
sunset
sailed
into
the
purple
vapors
sailed
into
the
dusk
of
evening
and
the
people
from
the
margin
watched
him
floating
rising
sinking
till
the
birch
canoe
seemed
lifted
high
into
that
sea
of
splendor
till
it
sank
into
the
vapors
like
the
new
moon
slowly
slowly
sinking
in
the
purple
distance
and
they
said
farewell
forever
said
farewell
o
hiawatha
and
the
forests
dark
and
lonely
moved
through
all
their
depths
of
darkness
sighed
farewell
o
hiawatha
and
the
waves
upon
the
margin
rising
rippling
on
the
pebbles
sobbed
farewell
o
hiawatha
and
