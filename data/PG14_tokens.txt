also
referred

ships
on

will
fly
the

variant
of
it

will
be
subject
to
the
maritime

and

rules
of

although
the
nature
of
a
captive

makes
it
especially
desirable
for
ships
owned
in
the

country
just
as
in

the

the

true
foc
registers
are
characterized
by
having
relatively
few
of

actually
owned
in

state
thus
while
virtually
any
flag
can
be
used
for
ships
under
a
given
set
of
circumstances
an
foc
register
is
one
where
the
majority
of
the
merchant
fleet
is
owned
abroad
it
is
also
referred
to
as
an

is

holds

internal

a
register
of

maintained
as
a
subset
of
a

ships
on
the
internal

fly
the
national
flag
and
have
that
nationality
but
are
subject
to
a
separate
set
of
maritime
rules
from
those
on
the
main
national
register
these
differences
usually
include
lower
taxation
of
profits
manning
by
foreign
nationals
and
usually
ownership
outside
the

state
when
it
functions
as

the
norwegian
international
ship
register
and
danish
international
ship
register
are
the
most
notable
examples
of
an
internal
register
both
have
been
instrumental
in
stemming
flight
from
the
national
flag
to
flags
of
convenience
and
in
attracting

to
the
norwegian

overview
over

the
economy
has
registered
a
remarkable
performance
because
of
the
development
of
an
offshore

real
gdp
growth
annually
averaged
from
to
in
cameroon
had
one
of
the
highest
levels
of
income
per

in
tropical
africa
with
oil
revenues
picking
up
the
slack
as
growth
in
other
sectors
softened
because
of
the
sharp
drop
in
oil
prices
however
the
economy
is
now
experiencing
serious
budgetary
difficulties
and
disequalibrium
oil
reserves
currently
being
exploited
will
be
depleted
in
the
early

ways
must
be
found
to
boost
agricultural

exports

economy
overview
beginning
in
late
the
chinese
leadership
has
been
trying
to
move
the
economy
from
the
sluggish
centrally
planned
economy
to
a
more
productive
and
flexible
economy
with
market
elements
but
still
within
the
framework
of
monolithic
communist
control
to
this
end
the
authorities
have
switched
to
a
system
of
household
responsibility
in
agriculture
in
place
of
the
old
collectivization
increased
the
authority
of
local
officials
and
plant
managers
in
industry
permitted
a
wide
variety
of
enterprise
in
services
and
light
manufacturing
and
opened
the
foreign
economic
sector
to
increased
trade
and
joint
ventures
the
most
gratifying
result
has
been
a
strong
spurt
in
production
particularly
in
agriculture
in
the
early
otherwise
the
leadership
has
often
experienced
in
its
hybrid
system
the
worst
results
of
socialism
bureaucracy
lassitude
corruption
and
of
capitalism
windfall
gains
and
inflation
beijing
thus
has
periodically
backtracked
retightening
central
controls
at
intervals
and
thereby
undermining
the
credibility
of
the
reform
process
open
inflation
and

following

most
industrial

overregulation

even
so
the

grew
rapidly
during
the
late

early
but
in
the
collapse
of
world
oil
prices
and
an
increasingly
heavy
burden
of

led
egypt
to
begin
negotiations
with

for

as

the
imf
the

agreed
to
institute
a

promote

economy
overview
one
of
the
world
most
developed
economies
france
has
substantial
agricultural
resources
and
a
highly
diversified
modern
industrial
sector
large
tracts
of
fertile
land
the
application
of
modern
technology
and
subsidies
have
combined
to
make
it
the
leading
agricultural
producer
in
western
europe
france
is
largely
in
agricultural
products
and
is
a
major
exporter
of
wheat
and
dairy
products
the
industrial
sector
generates
about
of
gdp
and
employs
about
of
the
work
force
during
the
period
economic
growth
was
sluggish
averaging
only
annually
this
trend
was
reversed
by
late
however
with
a
strong
expansion
of
consumer
demand
followed
by
a
surge
in
investment
the
economy
has
had
difficulty
generating
enough
jobs
for
new
entrants
into
the
labor
force
resulting
in
a
high
unemployment
rate
but
the
upward
trend
in
growth
recently
pushed
the
jobless
rate
below
the
steadily
advancing
economic
integration

economy
overview
the
bathist
regime
engages
in
extensive
central
planning
and
management
of
industrial
production
and
foreign
trade
while
leaving
some
industry
and
services
and
most
agriculture
to
private
enterprise
the
economy
is
dominated
by
the
oil
sector
which
provides
about
of
foreign
exchange
earnings
since
the
early
financial
problems
caused
by
war
expenditures
and
damage
to
oil
export
facilities
by
iran
have
led
the
government
to
implement
austerity
measures
and
to

foreign

payments
oil
exports
have
gradually
increased
with

agricultural

remains

the

economy
overview
israel
has
a
market
economy
with
substantial
government
participation
it
depends
on
imports
for
crude
oil
food
grains
raw
materials
and
military
equipment
despite
limited
natural
resources
israel
has
developed
its
agriculture
and
industry
sectors
on
an
intensive
scale
over
the
past
years
industry
accounts
for
about
of
the
labor
force
agriculture
for
and
services
for
most
of
the
balance
diamonds
machinery
and
agricultural
products
fruits
and
vegetables
are
the
biggest
export
earners
the
balance
of
payments
has
traditionally
been
negative
but
is
offset
by
large
transfer
payments
and
foreign
loans
nearly
of
israel
billion
external
debt
is
owed
to
the
us
which
is
its
major
source
for
economic
and
military
aid
to
earn
needed
foreign
exchange
israel
must
continue
to
exploit
niches
in
the
international
market
such
as
medical
scanning
equipment
in
the
economy
showed
a
growth
in
real
gnp
the
best
gain
in
nearly
a
decade
in
the
gain
was
only
annually
largely
because
of
the
economic
impact
of
the
palestinian
uprising
intifadah
inflation
dropped
from

growing

brought

the
original
cause
of
the
war
continuing
israeli
concern
about

israeli
forces
occupied
all

the
southern

of
the

economy
overview
the
economy
depends
primarily
upon
revenues
from
the
oil
sector
which
contributes
virtually
all
export
earnings
and
over
to
gnp
since
however
the
sharp
drop
in
oil
prices
and
resulting
decline
in
export
revenues
has
adversely
affected
economic
development
in
per

gnp
was
the
highest
in
africa
at
but
it
had
been
higher
in
severe
cutbacks
in
imports
over
the
past
five
years
have
led
to
shortages
of
basic
goods
and
foodstuffs
although
the
reopening
of
the
border
in
april
and
the
border
in
december
have
somewhat
eased
shortages
austerity
budgets
and
a
lack
of

have
undermined
the
ability
to
implement
a
number
of
planned

projects
the
nonoil
industrial

account
for
about

economy
overview
pakistan
is
a
poor
third
world
country
faced
with
the
usual
problems
of
rapidly
increasing
population
sizable
government
deficits
and
heavy
dependence
on
foreign
aid
in
addition
the
economy
must
support
a
large
military
establishment
and
provide
for
the
needs
of
million
afghan
refugees
a
real
economic
growth
rate
averaging
in
recent
years
has
enabled
the
country
to
cope
with
these
problems
almost
all
agriculture
and
industry
is
in
private
hands
and
the
government
seeks
to
privatize
a
portion
of
the
industrial
enterprises
now
publicly
owned
in
december
pakistan
signed
a
economic
reform
agreement
with
the
imf
which
provides
for
a
reduction
in
the
government
deficit
and
a
liberalization
of
trade
in
return
for
further
imf
financial
support
the
islamization
of
the
economy
has
affected
mainly
the
financial
sector
for
example
a
prohibition
on
certain
types
of
interest
payments
pakistan

overview
the

remained
dependent
on
cocoa
since
the
gained
independence
nearly
years
ago
since
then
however
cocoa
production
has
gradually
deteriorated
because
of
drought
and
mismanagement
so
that
by
output
had
fallen
to
less
than
of
its
former
levels
as
a
result
a
shortage
of
cocoa
for
export
has
created
a
serious
problem
production
of
less
important
crops
such
as
coffee
copra
and
palm
kernels
has
also
declined
the
value
of
imports
generally
exceeds
that
of
exports
by
a
ratio
of
to
the
emphasis

economy
overview
many
of

of
the
south
african
population
enjoy
incomes
material

and
health
and
educational
standards
equal
to
those
of

in

most
of
the
remaining
population
suffers
from
the
poverty
patterns
of

and
barriers
to

into

thus
do
not
move
smoothly
into
the
most

and
the
effectiveness
of
the
market
is
further
lowered
by
international
constraints
on

economy
overview
the
first

of

economic

have
undermined
the
institutions
and
processes
of
the
soviet
command
economy
without
replacing
them
with
efficiently
functioning
markets
the
initial
reforms
featured
greater
authority
for
enterprise
managers
over
prices
wages
product
mix
investment
sources
of
supply
and
customers
but
in
the
absence
of
effective
market
discipline
the
result
was
the
disappearance
of
goods
excessive
wage

an

of

has
made
at
least
four
serious
errors
in
economic
policy
in
these
five
years
the
unpopular
and
campaign
the
initial
cutback
in
imports
of
consumer
goods
the
failure
to
act
decisively
for
the
privatization
of
agriculture
and
the
buildup
of
a
massive
overhang
of
unspent
rubles
in
the
hands
of
households
and
enterprises
in
october
a
top
economic
adviser
leonid
abalkin
presented
an
ambitious
but
reasonable
timetable
for
the
conversion
to
a
partially
privatized
market
system
in
the
in
december
however
premier
ryzhkov
conservative
approach
prevailed
namely
the
contention
that
a
period
of
retrenchment
was
necessary
to
provide
a
stable
financial
and
legislative
base
for
launching
further
reforms
accordingly
the
new
strategy
was
to
put
the
reform
process
on
hold
in
by
recentralizing
economic
authority
and
to
placate
the
through
sharp
increases
in
consumer
goods
output
in
still
another
policy
twist
the
leadership
in
early
was
considering
a
marked
speedup
in
the
marketization
process
because
the
economy
is
caught
in
between
two
systems
there
was
in
an
even
greater
mismatch
between
what
was
produced
and
what
would
serve
the
best
interests
of
enterprises
and
households
meanwhile
the
seething
nationality
problems
have
been
dislocating
regional
patterns
of
economic
specialization
and
pose
a
further
major
threat
to
growth

has
suffered
because
of
the

the
government
in
response
to
the
revenue
loss
pursued
a

pushed

overview
the
economy
depends
primarily
on
petroleum
phosphates
and
tourism
for
continued
growth
two
successive
crop
failures
have
strained
the

budget

increased

the
current
account
fell
from
a

surplus
in
to
a

despite

tunis
appears
committed
to
its
structural

program
nonetheless
the

may
have
to
slow

to

off

the

overview
the

increasing
more

agriculture
remains
the
most

impressive

facing
turkey
inflation

for

from

economy
the

the
building
of
a

dams
on

economy
overview
tito
reform
programs
years
ago
changed
the
stalinist
command
economy
to
a
decentralized
semimarket
system
but
a
system
that
the
rigid
ethnically
divided
political
structure
ultimately
could
not
accommodate
a
prominent
feature
of
the
reforms
was
the
establishment
of
workers
councils
in
all
large
plants
which
were
to
select
managers
stimulate
production
and
divide
the
proceeds
the
general
result
of
these
reforms
has
been
rampant
inflation
substantial
rundown
of
capital
plant
consumer
shortages
and
a
still
larger
income
gap
between
the
poorer
southern
regions
and
the
relatively
affluent
northern
provinces
of
hrvatska
and
slovenija
in
the
beleaguered
central
government
has
been
reforming
the
reforms
trying
to
create
an
open
market
economy
with
still
considerable
state
ownership
of
major
industrial
plants
these
reforms
have
been
moving
forward
with
the
advice
and
support
of
the
international
monetary
fund
through
a
series
of
tough
negotiations
supposedly
is
to
be
replaced
by
the
discipline
of
the
market
and
by
fiscal
austerity
ultimately
leading
to
a
stable
dinar
however
strikes
in
major
plants
hyperinflation
and
interregional
political
jousting
have
held
back
progress
according
to
us
economic
advisers
only
a
highly
unlikely
combination
of
genuine
privatization
massive
western
economic
investment
and
aid
and
political
moderation
can
salvage
