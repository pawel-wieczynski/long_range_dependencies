one
caution
the

may
differ
substantially
from

finally
as

true

under

an

a

are

from

these

usually
include
lower
taxation

manning

the
chinese

been
trying
to
move
the

from

planned

to
a
more
productive
and
flexible
economy
with
market
elements
but
still
within
the
framework
of
monolithic
communist
control
to
this
end
the
authorities
have
switched
to
a
system
of
household
responsibility
in
agriculture
in
place
of
the
old
collectivization
increased
the
authority
of
local
officials

plant
managers
in
industry
permitted
a
wide
variety
of
enterprise
in
services
and
light
manufacturing
and
opened
the
foreign
economic
sector
to
increased
trade
and
joint
ventures
the
most
gratifying
result
has
been
a
strong
spurt
in
production
particularly
in
agriculture
in
the
early
otherwise
the
leadership
has
often

industrial
production
in

is
down
from

the
biggest
danger
is
that
soaring
unemployment

the
original
cause
of
the

continuing
israeli
concern
about
the

led
to
the

invasion
of

in
june
israeli
forces
occupied
all
of
the
southern
portion
of
the

and
mounted
a
siege
of

resulted
in

supervision
of

christian
militiamen

hundreds

specifiying

in

the

economy
it

moderate
land

with
close

now

it
has

changes
in

the

the

a

in

the
first
six
years
of
perestroyka
economic
and
political
restructuring
have
undermined
the
institutions
and
processes
of
the
soviet
command
economy
without
replacing
them
with
efficiently
functioning
markets
the
initial
reforms
have
featured
greater
authority
for
enterprise
managers
over
prices
wages
product
mix
investment
sources
of
supply
and
customers
but
in
the
absence
of
effective
market
discipline
the
result
has
been
the
disappearance
of
goods
excessive
wage
increases
an
even
larger
volume
of
unfinished
construction
projects
and
in
general
continued
economic
stagnation
the
gorbachev
regime
has
made
at
least
four
serious
errors
in
economic
policy
in
these
six
years
the
unpopular
and
antialcohol
campaign
the
initial
cutback
in
imports
of
consumer
goods
the
failure
to
act
decisively
at
the
beginning
for
the
privatization
of
agriculture
and
the
buildup
of
a
massive
overhang
of
unspent
rubles
in
the
hands
of
households
and
enterprises
the
regime
has
vacillated
among
a
series
of
ambitious
economic
policy
prescriptions
put
forth
by
leading
economists
and
political
leaders
the
plans
vary
from
proposals
for
a
quick
marketization
of
the
economy
b
gradual
marketization
c
a
period
of
retrenchment
to
ensure
a
stable
base
for
future
marketization
and
d
a
return
to
disciplined
central
planning
and
allocation
the
economy
caught
between
two
systems
is
suffering
from
even
greater
mismatches
between
what
is
being
produced
and
what
would
serve
the
best
interests
of
enterprises
and
households
meanwhile
the
seething
nationality
problems
have
been
dislocating
regional
patterns
of
economic
specialization
and
pose
a
further
major
threat
to
growth
prospects
over
the
next
few
years
official
soviet

report
gnp
fell

but
the
actual
decline
was
substantially
greater

the
numerical

it

increasing

because
of

economic

the

subject
to
even
greater
uncertainties
than
in
earlier
years
the

estimates
most
likely
overstate
soviet

of

incomplete

the
swedish
model
has
succeeded
in
making
economic
efficiency
and
social
egalitarianism
complementary
rather
than
competitive
goals
others
argue
that
the
swedish
model
is
on
the
verge
of
collapsing
by
pointing
to
the
serious
economic
problems
sweden
faces
in
high
inflation
and
absenteeism
growing
unemployment
and
deficits
and
declining
international
competitiveness
in
to
improve
the
economy
the
government
approved
a
mandate
for
sweden
to
seek
ec
membership
and
an
austerity
and
privatization
package
and
implemented
a
major
tax
