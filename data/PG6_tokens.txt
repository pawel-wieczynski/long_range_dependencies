patrick
henry
march
no
man
thinks
more
highly
than
i
do
of
the
patriotism
as
well
as
abilities
of
the
very
worthy
gentlemen
who
have
just
addressed
the
house
but
different
men
often
see
the
same
subject
in
different
lights
and
therefore
i
hope
it
will
not
be
thought
disrespectful
to
those
gentlemen
if
entertaining
as
i
do
opinions
of
a
character
very
opposite
to
theirs
i
shall
speak
forth
my
sentiments
freely
and
without
reserve
this
is
no
time
for
ceremony
the
question
before
the
house
is
one
of
awful
moment
to
this
country
for
my
own
part
i
consider
it
as
nothing
less
than
a
question
of
freedom
or
slavery
and
in
proportion
to
the
magnitude
of
the
subject
ought
to
be
the
freedom
of
the
debate
it
is
only
in
this
way
that
we
can
hope
to
arrive
at
truth
and
fulfill
the
great
responsibility
which
we
hold
to
god
and
our
country
should
i
keep
back
my
opinions
at
such
a
time
through
fear
of
giving
offense
i
should
consider
myself
as
guilty
of
treason
towards
my
country
and
of
an
act
of
disloyalty
toward
the
majesty
of
heaven
which
i
revere
above
all
earthly
kings
president
it
is
natural
to
man
to
indulge
in
the
illusions
of
hope
we
are
apt
to
shut
our
eyes
against
a
painful
truth
and
listen
to
the
song
of
that
siren
till
she
transforms
us
into
beasts
is
this
the
part
of
wise
men
engaged
in
a
great
and
arduous
struggle
for
liberty
are
we
disposed
to
be
of
the
number
of
those
who
having
eyes
see
not
and
having
ears
hear
not
the
things
which
so
nearly
concern
their
temporal
salvation
for
my
part
whatever
anguish
of
spirit
it
may
cost
i
am
willing
to
know
the
whole
truth
to
know
the
worst
and
to
provide
for
it
i
have
but
one
lamp
by
which
my
feet
are
guided
and
that
is
the
lamp
of
experience
i
know
of
no
way
of
judging
of
the
future
but
by
the
past
and
judging
by
the
past
i
wish
to
know
what
there
has
been
in
the
conduct
of
the
british
ministry
for
the
last
ten
years
to
justify
those
hopes
with
which
gentlemen
have
been
pleased
to
solace
themselves
and
the
house
is
it
that
insidious
smile
with
which
our
petition
has
been
lately
received
trust
it
not
sir
it
will
prove
a
snare
to
your
feet
suffer
not
yourselves
to
be
betrayed
with
a
kiss
ask
yourselves
how
this
gracious
reception
of
our
petition
comports
with
those
warlike
preparations
which
cover
our
waters
and
darken
our
land
are
fleets
and
armies
necessary
to
a
work
of
love
and
reconciliation
have
we
shown
ourselves
so
unwilling
to
be
reconciled
that
force
must
be
called
in
to
win
back
our
love
let
us
not
deceive
ourselves
sir
these
are
the
implements
of
war
and
subjugation
the
last
arguments
to
which
kings
resort
i
ask
gentlemen
sir
what
means
this
martial
array
if
its
purpose
be
not
to
force
us
to
submission
can
gentlemen
assign
any
other
possible
motive
for
it
has
great
britain
any
enemy
in
this
quarter
of
the
world
to
call
for
all
this
accumulation
of
navies
and
armies
no
sir
she
has
none
they
are
meant
for
us
they
can
be
meant
for
no
other
they
are
sent
over
to
bind
and
rivet
upon
us
those
chains
which
the
british
ministry
have
been
so
long
forging
and
what
have
we
to
oppose
to
them
shall
we
try
argument
sir
we
have
been
trying
that
for
the
last
ten
years
have
we
anything
new
to
offer
upon
the
subject
nothing
we
have
held
the
subject
up
in
every
light
of
which
it
is
capable
but
it
has
been
all
in
vain
shall
we
resort
to
entreaty
and
humble
supplication
what
terms
shall
we
find
which
have
not
been
already
exhausted
let
us
not
i
beseech
you
sir
deceive
ourselves
sir
we
have
done
everything
that
could
be
done
to
avert
the
storm
which
is
now
coming
on
we
have
petitioned
we
have
remonstrated
we
have
supplicated
we
have
prostrated
ourselves
before
the
throne
and
have
implored
its
interposition
to
arrest
the
tyrannical
hands
of
the
ministry
and
parliament
our
petitions
have
been
slighted
our
remonstrances
have
produced
additional
violence
and
insult
our
supplications
have
been
disregarded
and
we
have
been
spurned
with
contempt
from
the
foot
of
the
throne
in
vain
after
these
things
may
we
indulge
the
fond
hope
of
peace
and
reconciliation
there
is
no
longer
any
room
for
hope
if
we
wish
to
be
free
if
we
mean
to
preserve
inviolate
those
inestimable
privileges
for
which
we
have
been
so
long
contending
if
we
mean
not
basely
to
abandon
the
noble
struggle
in
which
we
have
been
so
long
engaged
and
which
we
have
pledged
ourselves
never
to
abandon
until
the
glorious
object
of
our
contest
shall
be
obtained
we
must
fight
i
repeat
it
sir
we
must
fight
an
appeal
to
arms
and
to
the
god
of
hosts
is
all
that
is
left
us
they
tell
us
sir
that
we
are
weak
unable
to
cope
with
so
formidable
an
adversary
but
when
shall
we
be
stronger
will
it
be
the
next
week
or
the
next
year
will
it
be
when
we
are
totally
disarmed
and
when
a
british
guard
shall
be
stationed
in
every
house
shall
we
gather
strength
by
irresolution
and
inaction
shall
we
acquire
the
means
of
effectual
resistance
by
lying
supinely
on
our
backs
and
hugging
the
delusive
phantom
of
hope
until
our
enemies
shall
have
bound
us
hand
and
foot
sir
we
are
not
weak
if
we
make
a
proper
use
of
those
means
which
the
god
of
nature
hath
placed
in
our
power
the
millions
of
people
armed
in
the
holy
cause
of
liberty
and
in
such
a
country
as
that
which
we
possess
are
invincible
by
any
force
which
our
enemy
can
send
against
us
besides
sir
we
shall
not
fight
our
battles
alone
there
is
a
just
god
who
presides
over
the
destinies
of
nations
and
who
will
raise
up
friends
to
fight
our
battles
for
us
the
battle
sir
is
not
to
the
strong
alone
it
is
to
the
vigilant
the
active
the
brave
besides
sir
we
have
no
election
if
we
were
base
enough
to
desire
it
it
is
now
too
late
to
retire
from
the
contest
there
is
no
retreat
but
in
submission
and
slavery
our
chains
are
forged
their
clanking
may
be
heard
on
the
plains
of
boston
the
war
is
inevitable
and
let
it
come
i
repeat
it
sir
let
it
come
it
is
in
vain
sir
to
extenuate
the
matter
gentlemen
may
cry
peace
peace
but
there
is
no
peace
the
war
is
actually
begun
the
next
gale
that
sweeps
from
the
north
will
bring
to
our
ears
the
clash
of
resounding
arms
our
brethren
are
already
in
the
field
why
stand
we
here
idle
what
is
it
that
gentlemen
wish
what
would
they
have
is
life
so
dear
or
peace
so
sweet
as
to
be
purchased
at
the
price
of
chains
and
slavery
forbid
it
almighty
god
i
know
not
what
course
others
may
take
but
as
for
me
give
me
liberty
or
give
me
death
